&amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 5 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;th width=50%&gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &amp;amp;#34;triangulation&amp;amp;#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &amp;amp;#34;triangulated&amp;amp;#34; by your wife and mother.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is often seen in families. It&amp;#39;s seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn&amp;#39;t go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it&amp;#39;s easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That&amp;#39;s what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else&amp;#39;s perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don&amp;#39;t like each other and can&amp;#39;t get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son&amp;#39;s wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn&amp;#39;t like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law&amp;#39;s relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife&amp;#39;s viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom&amp;#39;s cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family&amp;#39;s situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don&amp;#39;t agree with them. They will get upset if you don&amp;#39;t align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one&amp;#39;s side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &lt;/th&gt;&lt;td width=50%&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:0.1% data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=right data-html=true data-delay=500&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;th width=50%&gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This sounds like a potentially serious situation. The most important thing is to make sure the child is safe. &amp;amp;nbsp;If you suspect that a child is (or has been) harmed, I would strongly recommend that you report your concerns to your local law enforcement or to Child Protective Services. If you don&amp;#39;t think that a child is in danger, you can still report your suspicion of counselor misconduct to the state regulatory board.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &lt;/th&gt;&lt;td width=50%&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:0.1% data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=right data-html=true data-delay=500&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;th width=50%&gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That&amp;#39;s a great question. There is such a wide range of ways to define &amp;#34;personality&amp;#34; that it is difficult to identify specific characteristics that are used to identify personality types.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;That being said, some clinicians will use standardized tests (or assessments) to assess a client&amp;#39;s type of personality. While these tests can&amp;#39;t tell us everything about a person, they can help us understand where we are within larger groups of different personality styles.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some counselors will also use a diagnostic tool (like the DSM or ICD) to help a client understand a diagnosis that is related to a personality disorder.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &lt;/th&gt;&lt;td width=50%&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:0.1% data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=right data-html=true data-delay=500&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 1 &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;th width=50%&gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp; I&amp;#39;m thankful to read your husband found care and that his suicide attempt wasn&amp;#39;t successful.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp; While he was hospitalized, and prior to his release, your husband would&amp;#39;ve been provided in writing a self-care action plan. This typically includes things like committing to a contract &amp;#39;not to harm&amp;#39; and what to do if he felt overwhelmed by his anger, depression, and hopelessness (e.g. call 911, call therapist, go to nearest hospital emergency department). Additionally, his protocol would&amp;#39;ve provided instructions for his taking medication(s) as directed, having a follow-up appointment(s) with his psychiatrist/psychologist/clinical social worker, and participating in some form of small group support.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp; If your husband&amp;#39;s struggling as you describe, and you are feeling overwhelmed or frightened for his (your) safety, I&amp;#39;d encourage you to seek immediate assistance. &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

For example, I bet it&amp;#39;s easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;#39;m not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That&amp;#39;s what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else&amp;#39;s perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don&amp;#39;t like each other and can&amp;#39;t get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son&amp;#39;s wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn&amp;#39;t like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law&amp;#39;s relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife&amp;#39;s viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom&amp;#39;s cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family&amp;#39;s situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don&amp;#39;t agree with them. They will get upset if you don&amp;#39;t align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one&amp;#39;s side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2nd row&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what&amp;#39;s healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That&amp;#39;s a great first step! It&amp;#39;s also good that you are able to identify that it&amp;#39;s not always a physical need that&amp;#39;s driving the addiction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you&amp;#39;re consciously trying to quit, you&amp;#39;ll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I&amp;#39;m on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I&amp;#39;ll give in and eat it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&amp;#39;re going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That&amp;#39;s normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That&amp;#39;s what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (&amp;amp;#34;Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.&amp;amp;#34;), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&amp;#39;ve suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they&amp;#39;re going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;3rd row&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now. There are several things to consider before you make a decision.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- You mentioned that you don&amp;#39;t want your wife and mom to know because you don&amp;#39;t want to hurt them – why would it hurt them? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Is it necessary for them to know this information?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them? (for you and for your wife and mom).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Once you have considered these, think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Also, if your wife or mom were in your situation right now, what do you think they would do themselves?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- If your wife and mom were in this situation, how would you feel? Would you want to know the secrets?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once you have looked at the problem from all angles, you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;4th row&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi there. It&amp;#39;s great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don&amp;#39;t lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle, right? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, &amp;amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m too pushy&amp;amp;#34;, can be rewritten as, &amp;amp;#34;I&amp;#39;m assertive and I go after what I want.&amp;amp;#34; It can be hard to do since we tend to get &amp;amp;#34;stuck&amp;amp;#34; in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that&amp;#39;s not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. You&amp;#39;ve already taken the first step, so keep moving forward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;5th row&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You didn&amp;#39;t say what or how many medications you&amp;#39;ve tried. Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous, but I haven&amp;#39;t heard of any that cause mouth blisters, so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you&amp;#39;ve suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you don&amp;#39;t have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting &amp;amp;#34;Ohm&amp;amp;#34; to meditate. It&amp;#39;s about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don&amp;#39;t give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you. Like medication, you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope this helps and best of luck to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div role=tabpanel class=&quot;tab-pane col-sm-12&quot; id=-3900598642635170590bottom--3900598642635170590string&gt;&lt;div class=row&gt;&lt;div class=col-sm-12&gt;&lt;h4 class=indent&gt;Common Values&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;freq table table-hover table-striped table-0&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Value&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Count&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Frequency (%)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;div class=bar style=width:0.3%&gt; &amp;nbsp; &lt;/div&gt; 0.3% &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr class&gt;&lt;td title=&quot;&lt;p&gt;What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &amp;#34;triangulation&amp;#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &amp;#34;triangulated&amp;#34; by your wife and mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is often seen in families. It&#x27;s seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn&#x27;t go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential.

The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization,&amp;nbsp;to get&amp;nbsp;follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter.&amp;nbsp; So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can&#x27;t remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn&#x27;t want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is always&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;good option if you are not sure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255. They can help you create a specific safety plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do hope things work out alright. Be well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin J.

Clearly this is something that has you very concerned. Sometimes thoughts are just thoughts, and they are pretty harmless.&amp;nbsp;Many people have thoughts of killing someone, but they would never actually do it. They really don&#x27;t even want to do it, they are just having a thought.&amp;nbsp;Other times,&amp;nbsp;thoughts are a sign of something more serious, and we should receive help when they start to worry us. I would recommend meeting with a counselor to discuss these thoughts. It is usually a safe environment where you can get advice with little judgement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, If you begin to start thinking about killing someone specific and making a plan to do it in reality- you should call for help immediately. By help, I mean 9-11,&amp;nbsp;or a family member or friend. You would want to get help before doing something to harm yourself and others. Again, none of this is to judge, but rather to encourage you to get the help you&#x27;re seeking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, when we become concerned about some aspect of our behavior, seeking counseling is usually a good choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be well, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin J.

In the past, they’ve had minor differences. For example, my wife would complain to me my mother is too overbearing; my mother would complain my wife is lazy.\\r\\nHowever, it’s intensified lately. I think the cause is my wife talked back to her once. Now, any little disagreement is magnified, leading to major disagreements. What can I do?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/escalating-disagreements-between-mother-and-wife&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Family Conflict&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kristi King-Morgan, LMSW&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/kristi-king-morgan-lmsw&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &amp;amp;#34;triangulation&amp;amp;#34; which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &amp;amp;#34;triangulated&amp;amp;#34; by your wife and mother.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is often seen in families. It&#x27;s seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn&#x27;t go to them to tell them, you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another, especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example, I bet it&#x27;s easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&#x27;m not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That&#x27;s what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else&#x27;s perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However, in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you want to put a stop to this triangulation, you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don&#x27;t like each other and can&#x27;t get along, your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son&#x27;s wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn&#x27;t like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law&#x27;s relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife&#x27;s viewpoint, this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom&#x27;s cooking, her housework, gardening, or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family&#x27;s situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Regardless of what the cause is, if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue, your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don&#x27;t agree with them. They will get upset if you don&#x27;t align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one&#x27;s side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases, if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other, ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;5566f94fa64752d71ec3ca64&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I&#x27;m addicted to smoking. How can I stop?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I&#x27;m planning to have baby, so I have to quit smoking - but it&#x27;s hard. Sometimes it&#x27;s not a physical need, it&#x27;s mental.\\r\\n\\r\\nI cannot help myself from thinking about smoking. What can I do to get rid of this addiction?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/i-m-addicted-to-smoking-how-can-i-stop&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Substance Abuse,Addiction&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Rebecca Duellman&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/rebecca-duellman&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what&#x27;s healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That&#x27;s a great first step! It&#x27;s also good that you are able to identify that it&#x27;s not always a physical need that&#x27;s driving the addiction.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For the next steps, I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit, such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you&#x27;re consciously trying to quit, you&#x27;ll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette, then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel, etc., etc. Well, if I&#x27;m on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer, eventually I&#x27;ll give in and eat it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You&#x27;re going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That&#x27;s normal and, for the most part, out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That&#x27;s what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought, acknowledge it (&amp;amp;#34;Ok, I kind of want a cigarette now.&amp;amp;#34;), but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself, think about something else, do something else, whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I&#x27;ve suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they&#x27;re going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually, it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Best of luck, and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;5567d26887a1cc0c3f3d8f46&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Keeping secrets from my family&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I have secrets in my mind, and I don&#x27;t know what to do with them. I don&#x27;t want to tell my wife and mom because I don&#x27;t want to hurt them. But I&#x27;m not sure how long that I can keep the secret to myself.\\n\\nWhat should I do? It&#x27;s becoming annoying and making me anxious. Help me out&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/keeping-secrets-from-my-family&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Family Conflict&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Jeevna Bajaj&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/jeevna-bajaj&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now. There are several things to consider before you make a decision.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- You mentioned that you don&#x27;t want your wife and mom to know because you don&#x27;t want to hurt them – why would it hurt them? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Is it necessary for them to know this information?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them? (for you and for your wife and mom).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Once you have considered these, think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- Also, if your wife or mom were in your situation right now, what do you think they would do themselves?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- If your wife and mom were in this situation, how would you feel? Would you want to know the secrets?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;- How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Once you have looked at the problem from all angles, you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;556bed15c969ba5861709df5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The Underlying Causes of Being Possessive&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I am extremely possessive in my relationships and this is hurting my friendships. How can I fix my underlying issues?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/the-underlying-causes-of-being-possessive&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Behavioral Change,Social Relationships&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Rebecca Duellman&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/rebecca-duellman&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi there. It&#x27;s great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone, fear of being alone, fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don&#x27;t lose them. The thing is, controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle, right? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself, positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example, thinking something like, &amp;amp;#34;I&#x27;m too pushy&amp;amp;#34;, can be rewritten as, &amp;amp;#34;I&#x27;m assertive and I go after what I want.&amp;amp;#34; It can be hard to do since we tend to get &amp;amp;#34;stuck&amp;amp;#34; in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust, you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further, but if that&#x27;s not an option for you right now, there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. You&#x27;ve already taken the first step, so keep moving forward.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;556ba115c969ba5861709de6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Can I control anxiety without medication?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I had a head injury a few years ago and my mind races all the time. I have trouble sleeping and have a lot of anxiety. Every medicine I have been on my body rejects; I get sick to my stomach and get blisters in my mouth. How can I calm my self down? I&#x27;m a wreck.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/can-i-control-anxiety-without-medication&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Anxiety&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Rebecca Duellman&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/rebecca-duellman&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You didn&#x27;t say what or how many medications you&#x27;ve tried. Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous, but I haven&#x27;t heard of any that cause mouth blisters, so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you&#x27;ve suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you don&#x27;t have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting &amp;amp;#34;Ohm&amp;amp;#34; to meditate. It&#x27;s about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don&#x27;t give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you. Like medication, you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope this helps and best of luck to you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;5&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;556b6940c969ba5861709de4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;How do I break an unhealthy relationship pattern?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.\\r\\nI seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.\\r\\nI am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I&#x27;m doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/how-do-i-break-an-unhealthy-relationship-pattern&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Relationship Dissolution&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kristi King-Morgan, LMSW&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/kristi-king-morgan-lmsw&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern. You seem to have some good insight into the situation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers, childhood trauma and/or abuse or neglect, or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self. This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy. I recommend a book titled “Boundaries: Where you end and I begin” by Anne Katherine. Another book that might be helpful is “Codependent No More” by Melody Beattie. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the meantime, until you can work through your personal issues, absolutely do not enter into another relationship. Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole, happy, emotionally healthy person on your own. Needing another person to define you is problematic. That’s too much to expect from any individual.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;For a relationship to be healthy and happy, both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own. That means having a clear sense of self, knowing who you are and what you want, knowing how to set healthy boundaries, and knowing how to meet your own needs. It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time. There will be times that they won’t be able to meet your needs. You have to know how to meet those yourself. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;When you are working on becoming the best you that you can be, eventually the right person will come into your life. Then you can CHOOSE to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you NEED them to complete you.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;6&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;556bec8cc969ba5861709df3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I have anger issues. I am extremely explosive about the simplest things&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/i-have-anger-issues-i-am-extremely-explosive-about-the-simplest-things&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Anger Management&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kristi King-Morgan, LMSW&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/kristi-king-morgan-lmsw&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I suggest that you work on emotional awareness. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns to say “I am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset. That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off. Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;7&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;5566f9a2a64752d71ec3ca67&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I’ve suffered from insomnia and nightmares for about 3 years&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;It takes me a long time to fall asleep; I’d estimate about two hours. I often have nightmares, starting with being eaten by a monster, and I often wake up frightened and unable to breathe.\\n\\nI believe I started losing sleep after breaking up with a girlfriend of 8 years. Also, my father’s business went bankrupt and my mother has a chronic condition. I was under a lot of stress, and life lost meaning.\\n\\nAfter improving my life and developing a habit of running and exercise to release stress, my symptoms improved. However in the past couple months, I started losing sleep again and having nightmares without warning. How can I solve this issue?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/i-ve-suffered-from-insomnia-and-nightmares-for-about-3-years&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sleep Improvement&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Danielle Alvarez&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/danielle-alvarez&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;First of all, exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health. That&#x27;s great that you have added this in your routine. Have you also considered altering your diet? Certain foods are linked with poor sleep. For example, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep, especially right before bed time.  On the other hand, warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleep.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Additionally, at bed time it&#x27;s important to keep your room dim, cool and without distractions (i.e. TV, IPad, Phone). Stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energy.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As far as your nightmares, there could be many causes contributing to them. Certain foods (many of the ones mentioned) or medications could be the culprit. Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing. Oftentimes, depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep, causing nightmares. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Finally, Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep. There are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if you&#x27;d rather not join a class right away. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved Z&#x27;s!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;8&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;5570b7fea03de6c365f45ba1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Unethical Therapy Practices&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;What do you do when a therapist and a parent drugs a child and makes up lies in order to stop the other parent&#x27;s custody visitation?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/unethical-therapy-practices&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Professional Ethics,Legal &amp;amp; Regulatory&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kristi King-Morgan, LMSW&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/kristi-king-morgan-lmsw&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I will admit I am confused about this question. Are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist? &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication. Most therapists won&#x27;t even get involved in a custody battle. They know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court. Of course, therapists are human and can make mistakes, but I find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation. Not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this, they are going to face criminal charges and jail time. If their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child, they don&#x27;t have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board. Every therapist is licensed in their state. There are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapist&#x27;s licensure.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Most accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly. Don&#x27;t accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad. Have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this. If this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported, but don&#x27;t try to ruin someone&#x27;s career unless you are sure this occurred.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;9&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;556bf606c969ba5861709df8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;My friends accusing me of having problems&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;They&#x27;re calling me names like hypocrite and a baby even when they act in the same manner as I do. I&#x27;m tired of being called names. What should I do?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/my-friends-accusing-me-of-having-problems&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Social Relationships&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Danielle Alvarez&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/danielle-alvarez&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner, correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts, emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling, maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However, make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the other hand, if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded, it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div role=tabpanel class=&quot;tab-pane col-sm-12&quot; id=sample-tail&gt;&lt;div id=sample-container class=col-sm-12&gt;&lt;table border=1 class=&quot;dataframe sample table table-striped&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;questionID&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;questionTitle&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;questionText&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;questionUrl&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;topics&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;therapistName&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;therapistUrl&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;answerText&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;upvotes&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1472&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;579eb688188cd61c1684e83c&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;My mother is trying to control my life and I don&#x27;t know what to do.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I am in my early 20s and I still live with my parents because I can&#x27;t afford to live alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy mother says that if I live under her roof I have to follow her rules.

Can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can &amp;amp;nbsp;both live with ?&quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If she is receptive , maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of &quot;guidleines&quot; that feel fair to you both . &amp;amp;nbsp; If this is too hard to do alone , perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come &amp;amp;nbsp;up with some kind of &quot;compromise contract.&quot; &amp;amp;nbsp; This is not an easy situation , but if you can approach your mom in a calm and &quot;mature&quot; way and suggest a planned, structured discussion that doesn&#x27;t take place in the heat of the moment , your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck !!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Elissa Gross&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1473&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;58c9c85398741803743bf6e9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;My daughter isn&#x27;t acting her age.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;My daughter seemed to be developing at a normal rate until about the age of 10. She then started to act younger than she is. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow she only wants to play with younger kids and she doesn&#x27;t act her age. I don&#x27;t know why this is happening. Is this normal?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/my-daughter-isn-t-acting-her-age&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Parenting,Children &amp;amp; Adolescents&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elissa Gross&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/elissa-gross&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hello.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior . &amp;amp;nbsp; It&#x27;s really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on . &amp;amp;nbsp;You are clearly an observant and hands on &amp;amp;nbsp;mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is ok.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is a tough question to answer without more information . &amp;amp;nbsp;With that said , I have found that &quot;under stress people regress.&quot; &amp;amp;nbsp;In other words , many people , children and adults alike , often regress and behave differently - as if they were younger than their actual age - when under stress . &amp;amp;nbsp; Therefore , my first question would be : has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress ? &amp;amp;nbsp;This could be anything from conflict at home , recent changes such as moving , divorce , a loss of some kind , switching schools , or losing a friend or friends . &amp;amp;nbsp; Additionally , sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers , they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence . &amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;amp;nbsp;I would suggest that you think about what stressors / changes may have occurred recently. &amp;amp;nbsp;You may also want to check in with her teacher (s) to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughter&#x27;s behavior at school .&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her. &amp;amp;nbsp;Something as simple as &quot; I have noticed that you aren&#x27;t spending time with the friends you used to hang out with ; it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately . &amp;amp;nbsp;Am I right about that ? &quot; and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as : &quot;did something happen with your friends that &amp;amp;nbsp;is making you not want to be with them?&quot; &quot;Has something been bothering you lately ? Are you feeling upset or worried ? &quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say &quot; I know that sometimes when I feel stressed or worried , I tend to act a little differently - sometimes I withdraw from my regular group of friends , or I get cranky and feel less like myself . &amp;amp;nbsp;I wonder if something like that is happening with you ?&quot;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and / or her teachers , perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might &amp;amp;nbsp;help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times , or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively . The more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter , including any changes or new stressors , &amp;amp;nbsp;any possible patterns to this behavior , if school has become more difficult socially and or academically , the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to her.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck! &amp;amp;nbsp; I believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of children&#x27;s behavior. &amp;amp;nbsp;I do, though, think that you will feel more assured about this &amp;amp;nbsp;if you can get to the bottom of what&#x27;s going on . &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1474&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;58c61c9298741803743bf6ca&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;What happens in a counseling session?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;After first meeting the client, what is the process that a counselor facilitates?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/what-happens-in-a-counseling-session&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Counseling Fundamentals&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elissa Gross&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/elissa-gross&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi. &amp;amp;nbsp;This is an excellent question ! &amp;amp;nbsp; I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist . &amp;amp;nbsp;In my work with people , once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person&#x27;a concerns and the issues they want help with , I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client&#x27;s current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress . &amp;amp;nbsp;I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track. &amp;amp;nbsp;We would then discuss the best plan to address the client&#x27;s concerns . &amp;amp;nbsp;Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful . &amp;amp;nbsp; I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this. &amp;amp;nbsp;I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won&#x27;t try just to avoid &quot;hurting my feelings&quot; or &quot;offending me.&quot; &amp;amp;nbsp;I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful &amp;amp;nbsp;strategies, I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don&#x27;t like / agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan . &amp;amp;nbsp;We the &amp;amp;nbsp; work together to come up with a plan that will be helpful , but also realistic and then revise it and try new things if necessary as we go along. &amp;amp;nbsp; If things aren&#x27;t improving , I am very happy and willing to try something new !&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I hope this is helpful for you !&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1475&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;57799c9772f4321a37b64221&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Is it normal to cry during therapy?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I start counseling/therapy in a few days (I&#x27;m freaking out) but my main fear is that I&#x27;ll cry and embarrass myself, is it something to worry about?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/is-it-normal-to-cry-during-therapy&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Anxiety,Counseling Fundamentals&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elissa Gross&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/elissa-gross&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hi there ! &amp;amp;nbsp;As someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years , I would say that crying is NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AT ALL ! Almost every single person I have worked with has cried at one point or another. &amp;amp;nbsp;Starting therapy takes a lot of courage; when you work with a therapist ,once you feel safe , &amp;amp;nbsp;you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before. &amp;amp;nbsp;I have seen &amp;amp;nbsp;people cry with sadness , cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time, cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard. &amp;amp;nbsp; I myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving. &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I can assure you that most , if not all , therapists expect clients to cry &amp;amp;nbsp;and there is nothing to be embarrassed about. &amp;amp;nbsp; Crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down. &amp;amp;nbsp; Crying is &amp;amp;nbsp;often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal .&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;So , to summarize , don&#x27;t worry at all about crying! It will probably feel uncomfortable &amp;amp;nbsp;at first , but I promise you , you will not be judged for crying in therapy. &amp;amp;nbsp; And it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and won&#x27;t judge you !&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck !!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1476&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;577189ba3c9e6b307a8ae61f&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;How should I handle the child I had with my ex-wife?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;My ex-wife married and used me to have a child. She now uses that child as a pawn. I know my child misses me, but I need to move on and not live in the past. How do I do this? Do I see my child as much as possible or very little? Is it more confusing for the child?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/how-should-i-handle-the-child-i-had-with-my-ex-wife&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Parenting,Relationship Dissolution&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Candice Lawhorn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/candice-lawhorn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The thing that confuses a child the most is for a parent to come and go from their life. Children have a way of making things their fault, even when they have done nothing wrong. Because of this, when parents cut off contact, the child thinks it&#x27;s their fault.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As hard as that already is for a child, it is even worse when a parent pops in and out of their life. This makes the belief even more strong for them. They start to think, &quot;why does dad keep leaving? What am I doing to keep making him go away?&quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I believe a child needs both parents in their life. Whether she used you for a child or not, that child still exists and never asked for this. They didn&#x27;t ask to be born into drama and two parents that can&#x27;t make things work.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;You can move on and start over while still maintaining a relationship with your child. If you start over far away, this may mean less visits but you&#x27;ll still be a part of their life. Just make sure when you make a commitment to this child to stick to it. Every child deserves that much.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Good luck to you! :-)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1477&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;56d2f2aa9471b0b41ec68e4d&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Is it healthy to embarrass a child as punishment?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;My grandson&#x27;s step-mother sends him to school with a pink Barbie backpack as a form of punishment.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/is-it-healthy-to-embarrass-a-child-as-punishment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Parenting,Family Conflict&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Candice Lawhorn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/candice-lawhorn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Absolutely not!&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It is never in a child&#x27;s best interest to use humiliation as punishment. This can lead to issues in the relationship between parent and child as well as the child&#x27;s social relationships. Kids have a hard enough time. To then go and cause them embarrassment is unconscionable.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The entire job of a parent is to prepare their child to become a successful, healthy adult. You do this by using healthy ways to teach a child when they make a mistake. Discipline shouldn&#x27;t be seen as punishment. It should be seen as a way to teach a lesson. What lesson could this possibility be teaching him? Absolutely nothing.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meanwhile, she is most likely damaging her relationship with him and causing great distress in his school day and peer interactions.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;She should be one of the people he can come to when he&#x27;s hurting; not someone who causes him pain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1478&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;5797a411b43cd7825e26e246&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;How do I fix my relationship?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;My boyfriend is in recovery from drug addiction. We recently got into a fight and he has become very distant.

The adopted mother was terminally ill upon adopting the baby and died when the child was just over one year old. The adopted father then remarried to a physically, psychologically, and emotionally abusive woman. The child was placed in foster care at 11 years old. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat might be the long term effects on an adult with this childhood history?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/questions/what-are-the-long-term-effects-of-losing-one-s-adopted-mother&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Family Conflict,Parenting,Children &amp;amp; Adolescents&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sherry Katz, LCSW&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;https://counselchat.com/therapists/sherry-katz-lcsw&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The true answer is, &quot;no one can really say with certainty&quot;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The variables are the way this child absorbs and adjusts to these significant changes in their life. &amp;amp;nbsp;All anyone can do is guess at this point and there&#x27;s no good reason to guess.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The only general certainty is that the adult whom this child becomes will have had a profound encounter with the biggest types of human losses a child can go through.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Some people become great teachers, therapists and philosophers who have this background. &amp;amp;nbsp;Some give up on life and hide away from others.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best anyone could do who knows this child is to offer love bc this is the greatest guarantee to show there are good people on this earth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;1480&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;5795952cbc069dff6a5339aa&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;How do I help my 20 year old boyfriend who says he hates his life?&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;I think adult life is making him depressed and we often sleep in on weekends untill 1 or 2 pm. We just eat, smoke weed, watch movies, and he&#x27;ll go on his phone all day.
