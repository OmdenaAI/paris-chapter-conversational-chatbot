The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister\\\\u2019s house everything changed. That\\'s when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that\\'s what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again.

In 2013 we started a relationship, and he even asked me to move in with him since I lived out of state. I planned to move in with him in 2014 after I finished school and he found a job. However, during this time we had a few arguments and broke up with each other for a short period of time. We decided later to make it work. Shortly after, I found out that I was pregnant. I wanted to tell him during his next visit. However, he never came to see me and instead asked me for money. After I gave him money, he quit answering my phone calls and texts. Soon after, I experienced a miscarriage. I texted him about what had happened, and he didn\\\\u2019t seem to care. I was extremely hurt by this. I still decided to move back as I had originally planned. He helped me with the move and replaced the money I had lent him. During this time, I asked if he wanted to be in this relationship because I needed to know. Although he says he did, I hardly ever see him. He never got a job, which was in the original plan. After that, we both started seeing other people for a short amount of time but once again got back together. Once we got back together, I cut all ties with the former relationship I had been in. I thought he had too. But I found out that he did not attempt to do as I did and was still talking with another woman. In fact, he had even sent inappropriate pictures to her. When I confronted him about this, he wasn\\\\u2019t apologetic. He said that he only did it to get even with me and was actually mad at me for looking through his phone. He even closed his car window on my finger and tried to throw me out of his car.

I was happy but I couldn\\'t help feeling disappointed too. I had told him numerous times before that I wanted him to do it in front of my friends and family. I know it sounds dumb to be upset but I couldn\\'t help how I was feeling. We are now married but the wedding and ring were also far from what I wanted and it wasn\\'t due to lack of funds.

But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too. I don\\'t know what to do. I need some closure or I\\'m not going to be able to move on from this. I don\\'t know what it is, but it\\'s driving me crazy. I\\\\u2019m so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He\\\\u2019s such a good person. I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can\\'t get it out of my head. I\\'m trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can\\'t sleep because my mind is racing. I\\'ve never been so hung up on something for this long ever. I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I don\\'t know if that\\'s a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I can\\'t move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I don\\'t want to. Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do.\\\\n\\\\nAnswers:\\\\n\\\\n\",\"203\":\"Every time I speak, he says I anger him.

She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public.

We have split twice before, and the first time was because he cheated. I took him back months later, and he really tried making it up to me by making a lot of changes. However, we continued to have issues because of my lack of trust. My insecurities and trust issues lead to physical abuse, which lead to us separating again. During that separation, he consoled himself by talking to the same girl he cheated on me with. But we then ended up back together and worked it out for a while until I got pregnant with our second child. The baby was a few months old, and he confessed to me about his secret relationship with her. He told me how he could never stop talking to her and how, during our issues, she has been and is the only women he\\'s gone behind my back with (but on a friendship level because she\\'s miles away). He confessed how he fought feelings for her and feels like he\\'s possibly in love with her too. He said he feels like he\\'s in love with the both of us now because this women has fallen for him, and she hasn\\'t been able to leave him alone since. Even though she knows that he\\'s still with me and happy with our family, she can\\\\u2019t help it, and he confessed how his feeling for her are mutual. Being that he loves me too, he wanted to be with the both of us at the same time. He wanted to have affairs with her behind my back by flying her out and staying at a hotels, but he didn\\'t want me to find out, so he told me everything. He said he didn\\'t want to continue to lie to me and so I can finally stop accusing him of being with other women when it\\'s only been this one girl the whole time. He feels like my insecurities and trust issues are what pushed him closer towards her, and that no matter what he did to do right, I would still accuse him. He\\'s caught up in his feelings and pretty much says that he wants her but doesn\\'t want me to leave him because I\\'m the one he wants to be with for the rest of his life. I\\'m of course hurt and in shock. I feel like I have to make a decision on whether I want to allow it and deal with having to share him or walk away. Both of these decisions are really hard to make because I feel like whether I stay or go, my heart will still be torn apart. I have to make a decision quick because she will be flying out sooner than I thought.\\\\n\\\\nAnswers:\\\\n\\\\n\",\"313\":\"I crave attention, companionship, and sex.

Throughout the entire first day that we met, he and I had the opportunity to interact quite a lot and instantly sparked a deep connection with one another. That same night, he and a friend stayed over at my house (without my mom\\'s acknowledgment) and we kissed. The next two days were a repetition of the first day. On the third night, my mother finally caught us, and I was kicked out of my house. I left with him of course, and we went from meeting each other to being like a married couple. It was very hard for us. His stepdad also kicked him out of his home, and we were staying at cheap hotels and friend\\'s houses with the little money we had. I quit my job and dropped out of school because it was hard to do anything without a stable home. There were times when we had nowhere else to go but sleep in the car outside a Walmart parking lot. Our honeymoon stage, as they call it, probably only lasted one month. After that, it was a downward spiral. We were constantly arguing about money, food, and our families. We kept having the famous \\\\\"you\\'re doing it wrong\\\\u2014do it this way\\\\\" argument. After six months, we moved across the country only to live the same thing, and that\\'s when the violence started. One afternoon, after a serious argument, he got into his truck and threatened to leave me. I was frightened that he would actually go through with his word, given that we had just moved to a place where we knew no one. He told me to let him leave or he would hit me. He had once promised he would never touch me, so I challenged him to do it. He slapped me, and ever since that time, when we have serious fights, he loses control and hurts me.

In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn\\'t the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I\\'m not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it\\'s not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn\\'t be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.\\\\n\\\\nAnswers:\\\\n\\\\n\",\"1186\":\"Every winter I find myself getting sad because of the weather.

What can I do?\\\\n\\\\nAnswers:\\\\n\\\\n\"},\"completion\":{\"0\":\" What you are describing is something psychologists have termed &34triangulation&34 which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead. You have been &34triangulated&34 by your wife and mother.This is often seen in families. It\\'s seen everywhere. How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didn\\'t go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain? It is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential. For example I bet it\\'s easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaint.I\\'m not saying triangulation is always a bad thing. Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree. That\\'s what therapists do every day! Sometimes just getting someone else\\'s perspective can help you see the issue clearer. However in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem. You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you love.If you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences. Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up. Even if they really don\\'t like each other and can\\'t get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle. Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior. It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other. These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it. Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife. I heard one mother-in-law describe her son\\'s wife as the gateway to her son. The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son. The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren. If your wife doesn\\'t like her mother-in-law she can severely hamper or damage her mother-in-law\\'s relationship with you and any children you two may have. From your wife\\'s viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to. If you regularly praise your mom\\'s cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated. This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike. I am not saying that this is the case with your family\\'s situation. These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours. Regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you don\\'t agree with them. They will get upset if you don\\'t align yourself with them against the other. They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other one\\'s side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should. In worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship. Change the dynamics before it spirals even further. END\",\"1\":\" Hi. Good for you in planning ahead to do what\\'s healthiest for your baby (and yourself). That\\'s a great first step! It\\'s also good that you are able to identify that it\\'s not always a physical need that\\'s driving the addiction.For the next steps I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur. The psychological (or mental) cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal. And if you\\'re consciously trying to quit you\\'ll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc. etc. Well if I\\'m on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually I\\'ll give in and eat it.You\\'re going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette. That\\'s normal and for the most part out of your control. But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought. That\\'s what you would have to work on changing. When you have that initial thought acknowledge it (&34Ok I kind of want a cigarette now.&34) but then change the thoughts that typically follow. Distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigarette.I\\'ve suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what they\\'re going to do when the time comes. Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it. Eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have it.Best of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit - your baby! END\",\"2\":\" It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now. There are several things to consider before you make a decision.- You mentioned that you don\\'t want your wife and mom to know because you don\\'t want to hurt them \\\\u2013 why would it hurt them? - Is it necessary for them to know this information?- What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them? (for you and for your wife and mom).- Once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation?- Also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves?- If your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel? Would you want to know the secrets?- How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical health?Once you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not. END\",\"3\":\" Hi there. It\\'s great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive. At the root of it is fear. Fear of losing someone fear of being alone fear of not being good enough. All those fears can lead to low self-esteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you don\\'t lose them. The thing is controlling other people only pushes them away. Vicious circle right? What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking. You can start with this assignment. Write down all the things you think about yourself positive and not-so-positive. Then rewrite those not-so-positive things so they are positive. For example thinking something like &34I\\'m too pushy&34 can be rewritten as &34I\\'m assertive and I go after what I want.&34 It can be hard to do since we tend to get &34stuck&34 in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves. If you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourself.Finding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if that\\'s not an option for you right now there are lots of self-help books and websites that are out there. You\\'ve already taken the first step so keep moving forward. END\",\"4\":\" You didn\\'t say what or how many medications you\\'ve tried. Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but I haven\\'t heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you\\'ve suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.But beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you don\\'t have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting &34Ohm&34 to meditate. It\\'s about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said it takes practice so don\\'t give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you. Like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentation.I hope this helps and best of luck to you. END\",\"5\":\" It is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern. You seem to have some good insight into the situation.The type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers childhood trauma and\\\\/or abuse or neglect or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self. This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy. I recommend a book titled \\\\u201cBoundaries: Where you end and I begin\\\\u201d by Anne Katherine. Another book that might be helpful is \\\\u201cCodependent No More\\\\u201d by Melody Beattie. In the meantime until you can work through your personal issues absolutely do not enter into another relationship. Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole happy emotionally healthy person on your own. Needing another person to define you is problematic. That\\\\u2019s too much to expect from any individual.For a relationship to be healthy and happy both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own. That means having a clear sense of self knowing who you are and what you want knowing how to set healthy boundaries and knowing how to meet your own needs. It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time. There will be times that they won\\\\u2019t be able to meet your needs. You have to know how to meet those yourself. When you are working on becoming the best you that you can be eventually the right person will come into your life. Then you can CHOOSE to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you NEED them to complete you. END\",\"6\":\" I suggest that you work on emotional awareness. Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways. If a man never learns to say \\\\u201cI am sad\\\\u201d or \\\\u201cthat really hurt my feelings\\\\u201d and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a \\\\u201csimple\\\\u201d thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern. It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset. That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off. Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience.  END\",\"7\":\" First of all exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health. That\\'s great that you have added this in your routine. Have you also considered altering your diet? Certain foods are linked with poor sleep. For example alcohol caffeine nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep especially right before bed time. On the other hand warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleep.Additionally at bed time it\\'s important to keep your room dim cool and without distractions (i.e. TV IPad Phone). Stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energy.As far as your nightmares there could be many causes contributing to them. Certain foods (many of the ones mentioned) or medications could be the culprit. Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender. You may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing. Oftentimes depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep causing nightmares. Finally Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep. There are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if you\\'d rather not join a class right away. Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved Z\\'s! END\",\"8\":\" I will admit I am confused about this question. Are you the other parent in question or a concerned coworker of this therapist? Therapists do not prescribe or have access to medication. Most therapists won\\'t even get involved in a custody battle. They know there is a good chance of their records ending up in court and that they themselves will have to testify in court. Of course therapists are human and can make mistakes but I find it highly unlikely that a therapist would knowingly and willingly do something like this that is such a major ethical violation. Not only are they losing their license to practice by doing this they are going to face criminal charges and jail time. If their clinical judgment is that the other parent is a danger to the child they don\\'t have to resort to illegal means to try to prove this. If you have concrete proof that this has happened then there is a process in which you can file a report against the therapist with their licensure board. Every therapist is licensed in their state. There are different types of licensures so you would need to know this therapist\\'s licensure.Most accusations from the other parent are expected in a custody situation because people do tend to get quite ugly. Don\\'t accuse the therapist or the parent of anything just to try to make yourself look better and them look bad. Have evidence of wrongdoing before accusing them of this. If this has really happened then of course it needs to be reported but don\\'t try to ruin someone\\'s career unless you are sure this occurred. END\",\"9\":\" It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner correct? Communication is key to any relationship. I would recommend speaking with your friends face-to-face to address why they feel your behavior is concerning. In-person contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts emails or any written response can be misconstrued. Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded. If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly. Especially if this friendship is valuable to you. However make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them. On the other hand if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship. Not all friendships are healthy ones. And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder it.I hope you are able to get this matter sorted. Best of luck! END\",\"10\":\" First of all my heart goes out to you. Infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome. There are some things that you should consider. First of all did he seem truly remorseful? If you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done it will give you a piece of mind that it was a mistake. Secondly was he forthcoming with this information? How about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered? If you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming the sting is even more painful. He should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitation.Thirdly has he shown a positive difference after this experience? At this time he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage you and the children.Keep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief. It is not a quick process that can easily be overcome. What you are experiencing is 100% normal. My best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist. Find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved. I know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration this is not a healthy environment either. If you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your children\\'s needs.Please know that you are not alone and that unfortunately many relationships have endured this very thing. It may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles. The web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding board.Best of luck to you and your family! END\",\"11\":\" It sounds as if you may be experiencing a bout of anxiety and\\\\/or depression. Sleeping difficulties irritability and anxiety attacks all are correlated with these mood disorders. And it\\\\u2019s actually quite common for someone to deal encounter this during their lifetime. Also keep in mind that just because you are experiencing this now does not mean that you will be dealing with it the rest of your life. Many times it can be a single episode and if treatment is received you can help prevent any recurrent episodes.However you may want to first talk with your primary physician to rule out any medical issues that could be causing these problems. There may be a reason for the sudden onset of these symptoms that can be addressed quickly. On the other hand if it is determined that you are experiencing anxiety and\\\\/or depression without a medical reason there are two methods that are very helpful in your treatment:1 Talk therapy with a certified therapistHe\\\\/She will be able to address the concerns you\\\\u2019re experiencing and discovering if there is an underlying issue that may be causing it.2 MedicationThere are many medications that can assist you with the feelings that you are experiencing. Your doctor will be able to help you find the right one that works for you. If one doesn\\\\u2019t work keep trying. There are many different options to address your specific needs.Also a combination of these two options is extremely beneficial!Thank you for your question. I sincerely hope that you feel better soon! END\",\"12\":\" I\\\\u2019m sorry to hear about your current situation. My heart goes out to you during this time.First of all it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor. Regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing. More than likely he\\\\/she will be able to help you relieve some of these symptoms.Secondly you must be upfront and honest with your husband. Intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling. I think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being him.If you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship. The conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial. And please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing (or lack thereof) was not your fault.Best of luck to you and your husband! END\",\"13\":\" Hi there. I have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why you are feeling the way that you are feeling. A lot of people secretly go about their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the answer might be.First off what stressors do you have in your life right now? Financial relationship and unemployment are all common stressors for people. They can often make it difficult for us to sleep at night due to the constant racing thoughts and wonders of how you will deal with it all. Secondly do you have a history of depression or does depression run in your family? Some of the symptoms listed here in this question (i.e. trouble sleeping constant fatigue too much sleep anger &amp anxiety) are all common symptoms of depression. Often times these symptoms can be overlooked and mistaken for &34just being tired.&34 Furthermore it\\'s important to ask yourself if you are feeling worthless problems with concentration and recurrent thoughts of death. If you are having these symptoms please seek help IMMEDIATELY. Lastly considering your stated symptoms I would recommend reaching out to your Doctor for further consult. It\\'s always better to be safe and the earlier you catch the symptoms the faster you will get to feeling better! do Some helpful tips for the your Doctor would be to monitor your sleep habits (i.e. how much or little are you sleeping) make a list of your triggers for your anger outbursts as well as your triggers for your anxiety attacks. I hope this was helpful and the best of luck to you. END\",\"14\":\" It is incredibly hard to let go of a relationship that was meaningful in your life. Even though you consider the relationship to be a hurtful one I\\\\u2019m sure there are some aspects about it that are hard to let go of (i.e. time invested mutual friends positive memories etc). So it is very understandable why it\\\\u2019s hard for you. However the most important piece here is that you know that this relationship is harmful. That is great that you have recognized this. Unfortunately some men and women do not realize the damaging and hurtful situation that that they are really in.Keep in mind that the longer you stay in this relationship the longer it will be until you find the RIGHT person. You are doing this to better yourself and your future. Look at it this way being in a destructive relationship is comparable to an illness or disease. You are simply taking the correct measures to rid you of this sickness and to get well.It may also help to write down a list of negative aspects of the relationship and keep it close if times arise when you begin to question yourself or start to miss this person. Constant reminders of why you ended the relationship will be helpful to keep you on right track and in the right mind setting.It will be difficult but it\\\\u2019s doable. Give your chance to start on your deserved happiness now.Best of luck! END\",\"15\":\" It sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about your pets. I do not know what all is going on in your family and I cannot answer for your dad\\\\u2019s actions or his reasoning behind this.I would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills. We cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us. If you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing (like your pets) then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress. It is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends hobbies games etc. Develop other things that you care about and are passionate about.Another reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you don\\\\u2019t have healthy ones you may develop some very unhealthy ones. You have to cope somehow right? Developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for you.I don\\\\u2019t know if this is what it is like for you at your house but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children. One is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything. The other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability. People need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe. Both of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping with life. Please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets any worse. END\",\"16\":\" I am sorry to hear of these troubles. I see a few issues here. I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled? Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly and I believe you. People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In fact giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a \\\\u201cself\\\\u201d outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be you will end up back together again. It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving. I suggest backing off and letting her go. Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind. If it is meant to be she will come back. If not use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own. END\",\"17\":\" I will assume that for whatever reason you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this. However I highly urge you to do so because long-term childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware. There are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse. Some\\\\/most also offer free counseling services in local areas. That would be a good place to start looking especially if cost of counseling is an issue.The important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past. Having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you. Angry? Yes! At your brother for what he did at your parents for not protecting you. Having trouble trusting? Of course! The very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead. Two books that might help you are Codependent No More and Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin. END\",\"18\":\" Hi there. Being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life. I remember when I was 15 and how I often felt my parents weren\\\\u2019t listening to me. It\\\\u2019s even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in. Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything! Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through. In addition to the communication problem with your parents it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety. We all have stress and anxiety in our lives. If we didn\\\\u2019t none of us would be living. Anxiety &amp stress keep us on our toes! Often I have to remind myself of this as well. However it is how we manage stress and anxiety so it will not overcome our lives. Are you familiar with relaxation techniques such as: deep breathing exercises meditation or yoga? Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety. Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go such as school shopping out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in. Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity. I know that sounds silly. But it\\\\u2019s true. You would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold. Imagine being in the Doctor\\\\u2019s office and taking deep breaths. This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed and\\\\/or stressed. Take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly. You will be surprised how well you feel afterwards. Meditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety. You will need a quiet place for your meditation. You want to be \\\\u201cin the moment\\\\u201d and take in the peace and serenity. All it takes is a quiet place closing your eyes and thinking of your \\\\u201chappy place.\\\\u201d Some people use meditation music as well. If you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation please go for it! Yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice. I would not suggest you learning this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before. Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes and\\\\/or ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students. Lastly in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating. I would recommend writing a letter to them if you are unable to express how you feel in person. A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end. If they are open on working on this relationship maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue. I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best!  END\",\"19\":\" I don\\'t think you\\\\u2019ve lost something I think you\\\\u2019ve found something - your breaking point and it\\'s about time.

I agree you need to talk to someone. The fact that you\\\\u2019ve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it (by saying you\\'re not affectionate enough etc.) tells me you probably have low self-esteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you don\\'t deserve any better. You do! You may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve. And although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that he\\'s not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children. What would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way? Would you want your sons to treat women this way? That\\'s what you\\'re teaching your children when they see this.Like I said I agree that you should talk to someone. You can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he won\\'t. Even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on YOU. I understand it\\'s not easy to just kick him out especially since you have children together but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your self-esteem and self-worth. END\",\"20\":\" Anything can become an addiction. Eating gambling shopping sex even exercising. It sounds like this has become a behavioral addiction for you. A therapist can help you identify the underlying reasons and help you learn to control the urges and develop healthier coping skills. People turn to an activity that makes them feel better when something is bothering them emotionally or mentally. Anything can become a problem if you overuse it. This is why it is important to have a healthy balance of activities in your life more than one thing that you can turn to in order to help you cope. Addictions are formed when we turn to the same thing over and over again. Sex is a very powerful addiction for some people. It makes us feel good. We get pleasure from it. I had a client that turned to eating as her \\\\u201caddiction.\\\\u201d The advice I gave her applies to your situation as well. Eating is something that we have to do and that an addict cannot \\\\u201ccold turkey\\\\u201d and walk away from. My client could not tell when she felt the urge to eat if it was because she was hungry or because she was upset about something and was subconsciously turning to food to make her feel better. Her body was telling her brain that she needed to eat. I asked her to first STOP and THINK when she felt the urge to eat. Look at the clock and mark the time. Tell herself that in one hour if she was still hungry then she could eat but that she needed to find something else to occupy her mind and her time until the hour had passed. She tried this for a week.She said it worked. She would get busy reading a book watching TV or would go for a walk around her neighborhood for exercise and these activities would take her mind off things and the hour would pass and she wouldn\\\\u2019t even notice the time. What this did for her was stop an unhealthy behavior and replace it with some healthier activities. She had to learn to first recognize when she was feeling the urge and then to come up with other activities to do instead. You can do this with your urges. Having sexual gratification as your one \\\\u201cgo to\\\\u201d method to cope is causing you distress. Make a list of other activities that you like and that you can engage in and when you feel the sexual urge make yourself do another activity for an hour to get your mind off of it. It may take a few tries to find an activity that will hold your attention. A habit that has developed over time is not going to be so easy to break.Please go to a medical doctor and get evaluated as well. They can do lab work and check your hormone levels. If needed medication can help. After being cleared medically counseling can help you. You stated that you have a disability that makes it impossible. A therapist can help you explore the feelings that you are experiencing due to the inability to have sex. This is a grief\\\\/loss issue in the same way that someone who had lost the ability to walk might be grieving over his mobility. Something that you used to be able to do now you cannot. It is expected that you might have some feelings of anger or sadness about this.

My first observation is to say that it is a tremendous advantage that your son is communicating what he is experiencing. I\\'d encourage him to continue to do so no matter the extent of his thoughts - his trust of you being able the handle his experience is of utmost importance. His containment and sense of security is also dependent on your reaction to what he shares.

You may be able to render this particular situation but it\\\\u2019s likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises. Therefore it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the future.Talk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga.

This tells me that you didn\\\\u2019t have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. Low self-esteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can\\\\u2019t do any better. Also abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get. The way I see it he did you a favor. You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be. Take this time alone to work on you. As hurtful as it may be that other people don\\\\u2019t want to help you this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you.

People can and will let you down. It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment learn to take care of your own needs and to gain a stronger sense of self. Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath do something that makes you feel good. Find a hobby that you enjoy.

I want you to know that I am here to help you in any way that I can. First and foremost you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man. I\\\\u2019m going to assume there are. So the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself if you and your children are safe? Is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going? If he is coming and going or currently living in the home my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe (i.e. family members home friend or a shelter temporarily). I cannot stress this enough. Although some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior (i.e. they only do it when they are drinking they only do it when they are mad) it\\\\u2019s those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation. So you can never take abuse (physical or mental) lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time. It\\\\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry. Secondly it will not be safe helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship. Abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors. This is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your children.It\\\\u2019s unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy however that is no longer your concern. Your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe. I would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues. I hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself.  END\",\"27\":\" It\\'s hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement. This was something that you and most women think about for years so it\\'s understandable to be disappointed. But please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect. You may envy your friends\\' weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own and\\\\/or it wasn\\'t as perfect as they had planned it either. However like you know the marriage is the most important thing. How many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship? I assure you that there are plenty. Try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired. Focus on what you can control NOW. Perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ring?I would also be upfront with your husband and explain why you\\'ve been short lately. But after that close that chapter and move on. It sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly don\\'t want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change. END\",\"28\":\" I am sorry that you lost your mother. That is a really hard thing for someone to go through.There is really no set time for grief to be over but I agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief. I do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job but I would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help. For one thing bills have to be paid.There are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order. You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced. Denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance are the stages. At first people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone. This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually died.Then comes bargaining in which you may beg God that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever. Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss. It sounds like you are stuck in this phase.Finally acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move on.When we lose someone we never forget them. We may always have certain days that are tough such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one. But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable and that life goes on.A therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it. One suggestion I have is not to try to run from the sad feelings don\\\\u2019t try to not feel them. Embrace the feelings. Let the feelings wash over you and accept them. Trying not to feel something is not going to help. Sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does. Unpleasant feelings are not to be avoided.I am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now. You deserve to be happy and to live a full life. I am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long. I wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief. END\",\"29\":\" I think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children.

I would say yes keep trying to fight for your family at least until you know what the problems are from your wife\\'s perspective and if they\\'re repairable. Ask your wife if she\\\\u2019s willing to try to work on the marriage and then see a marriage counselor. Just be sure you\\\\u2019re open to hearing what\\'s said and try not to get defensive if she blames you for some things.Even if your wife is adamant about getting a divorce that doesn\\'t mean you\\\\u2019re divorcing your daughter and you should make sure she knows that.

This is one of the hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move forward. In the mean time immerse yourself with positivity (i.e. Good friends hobbies exercise) and try to schedule a time with a counselor. Perhaps there will be a support group you could also join. Oftentimes it is comforting to meet others who share the same experience as you.Good luck to you. I hope you will find peace and comfort soon. END\",\"32\":\" I\\'m very sorry to hear this. Hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories. However keep in mind that hypnosis doesn\\'t work for everyone. I think regardless speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial. It seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward. In addition if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able to help you cope with them as they arise. I wish you the best of luck and I hope you receive the treatment that you deserve. END\",\"33\":\" Hi there. Wow this sounds like a sticky situation however I\\\\u2019m here to help guide you through this decision. First and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons\\\\u2019 father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child. It\\\\u2019s very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because \\\\u201cit\\\\u2019s the right thing to do.\\\\u201d Right? Well not entirely. Although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run. If you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating. When a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions &amp behaviors it is unhealthy as he\\\\/she will expect their own relationships to be such. As a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child. Just remember what you do your child will model. Secondly do not sell yourself short from love. Everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with. However being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky. Honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love. Humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need. If you decide to pursue the second relationship I would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days. Finally I am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys. This seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your child\\\\u2019s father or not. You should ask yourself if you were in love with your child\\\\u2019s father first off. If you were you would have never sought after love. I hope this was helpful for you and I hope I was able to shed a different light on your situation. Take care of yourself! END\",\"34\":\" I am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles. One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about? In the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this. I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history. For one thing it is a good idea to be checked for STD\\\\u2019s before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other. Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you don\\\\u2019t like to do. This gets into a gray area for some people. I don\\\\u2019t necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly don\\\\u2019t want a whole lot of details. Sometimes that is an image I just don\\\\u2019t want in my head about my partner. Vague details are usually enough.However I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past. This is a reflection on him not you. This shows insecurities on his part. You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information. The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future. If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship. You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you. I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity. It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though. If your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go. Don\\\\u2019t keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you. Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low self-esteem due to this type of treatment. I don\\\\u2019t see that you have done anything wrong. If you aren\\\\u2019t cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him. Ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go. Don\\\\u2019t fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you. It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be. In time the right person for you will enter your life. END\",\"35\":\" I\\'m sorry you are feeling uncared for. I\\'m sure there are plenty of people that care and love for you that you are not taking into consideration. Sometimes when we get upset we may think irrationally and see the world as all or nothing. However take a deep breath relax and start focusing on the positive relationships you have with others regardless of how small or insignificant they may seem. I think you will quickly realize there are people out there that care a great deal about you.I also think it would help for you to surround yourself among people who you can identify with and share common interests with. Maybe you can attend a religious service join an interest group (i.e. reading club sports group etc.) or start a group of your own. Most importantly you need to tap into your interests and surround yourself with things that are beneficial for your own mental and physical health. From this relationships will start to immerse. You may also like to talk with a therapist regarding your feelings of being unloved. This is an unhealthy way to think of yourself and I think with a little help you can see that you are more than deserving of a great relationship. Thanks for reaching out and I wish you the best of luck moving forward.  END\",\"36\":\" I can see why you are alarmed. That is a scary situation for a parent. Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional? Early treatment is often the key. A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses. Have you addressed your concerns with the child\\'s other parent? There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues (exposure to violence sexual\\\\/physical abuse drug use stressful events in his life etc.). It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated and\\\\/or reduced. I wouldn\\'t hesitate to have him evaluated (if he hasn\\'t been already) and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication and\\\\/or therapy. Until then I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adult\\'s care. END\",\"37\":\" This is difficult to answer because you don\\\\u2019t tell us what the fetish is. I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not. If this is illegal to engage in then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings. You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of. You may find other people have the same interest as you. Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them. Don\\\\u2019t hold back with your therapist. Trust me they have heard and seen it all by now and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are. There is no need to suffer with this alone.  END\",\"38\":\" I can\\\\u2019t give you legal advice but employers can suggest you see someone if your behavior is affecting your job. I believe most government agencies have an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) where employees can talk to a therapist about any issue not just work-related for free (up to a certain amount of sessions).I\\\\u2019m wondering though why your coworkers would tell your boss this if it\\\\u2019s not true. Is it possible that you\\'re not aware of how your interactions are affecting others? Maybe this \\\\u201cforced counseling\\\\u201d can be an opportunity for some introspection on your part. END\",\"39\":\" First of all if you\\\\u2019re sick and in pain have you seen your doctor? If you have a chronic illness and pain this can often lead to depression and is very common. You\\\\u2019ve taken the first step to dealing with it. You can talk to your doctor even if your depression isn\\\\u2019t related to your health. He or she can either look at prescribing you an antidepressant or can refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist.If that\\\\u2019s not really an option for you there are also helplines (local or national) or support groups where people dealing with similar issues can talk to each other. If you can\\'t find any in your area (newspapers usually publish this information) there are online support groups as well.  END\",\"40\":\" I\\'m sorry to hear that you are unable to get through to your parents. It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional (despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment). I would recommend talking with another adult such as a school counselor that can offer you support in this area. Perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that he\\\\/she may help mediate the conversation with them.If you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents. Sometimes it helps hearing it from a third party before the situations is taken seriously enough.Good luck! END\",\"41\":\" Try to think of his close relationship with his mother in a good way. It means that they have a positive family structure which can transfer down to your own family if you have one together in the future. Despite your boyfriend having a good relationship with his mother it will never be equal to the relationship that you have with him. A love for a mother is a very different love than one with a girlfriend or wife. There are certain things that he may look towards his mother for and certain things that he may look toward you for. So instead of comparing your relationship with him to the one he has with his mother try viewing them as two separate entities. She can not replace you and you cannot replace her. However all together you can have a positive healthy family dynamic. END\",\"42\":\" Hi there first off I have to commend you for reaching out. It takes a lot for a man to reach out for help when it comes to erection problems. Believe it or not this problem is very common for men and women. There are some things that you can try naturally before resulting in medication such as your eating habits and exercise. I would suggest taking a look at what you are consuming throughout the day. Do you consume a healthy diet and do you exercise regularly? How much caffeine and sugar do you intake daily? These are just a few common things to look at. You would be surprised of how much pressure what we consume puts on our bodies. Our bodies are like a car. You have to maintenance it in order for it to continue to run. If you would like to get further natural advice and\\\\/or suggestions on eating healthy and exercising I would recommend you see a nutritionist. A nutritionist specializes in maintaining a healthy diet. As far as your Doctor I would recommend looking into getting another Doctor. I have never heard of a medical professional not wanting to talk about anything. That appears to be a personal issue on their part. I hope I was helpful and I wish you the best of luck! END\",\"43\":\" How has your husband acted since then? Was he regretful? How did you find out? Did he confess? These are all things that you want to consider. Betrayal is very hard to get over so if it\\'s taking you awhile to get over know that this is normal.Hopefully you\\'re husband has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened. It may take awhile to reestablish your trust with him and he should understand this. It\\'s also very important to discuss WHY he cheated. You want to make sure that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the future. And if it can there needs to be an action plan in place (i.e. being honest with how he\\'s feeling) so that you both get a chance to rectify the situation.If the cheating has happened more than once you may want to reevaluate your reasoning for staying in the marriage. It would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldn\\'t repeat the same mistake. However if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake I would give it a try. People do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you have.Know that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel. If the relationship was a good healthy relationship it is worth saving. Ease back into it and be upfront with your feelings. In return your husband should be patient and understanding of this. Also marriage counselors are often a good go-to as they have a great deal of experience working with marriages in similar situations. Best of luck to you! END\",\"44\":\" I want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it. You are already on the road to a happier life with this realization. A lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way. Until you realize there is a problem you won\\\\u2019t start looking for a solution.Don\\\\u2019t misunderstand me! The abuse is not your fault! You are seeing a pattern though so this does need to be addressed. First go and buy the book \\\\u201cBoundaries: Where You End and I Begin\\\\u201d by Anne Katherine. Read it. This book describes many situations that are similar to yours describes how a person came to be that way and how to stop it. You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain them.Be single for a while. Stay single until you feel like a whole healthy happy person on your own. Often we get in a relationship because of a need. If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons. The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life. Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your own.I was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife. This was a recurrent theme for her like you are saying it is for you. However she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy and this was a new relationship. Obviously she still had not \\\\u201cgotten it right\\\\u201d because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies. The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person. When she looked at him in our session and said to him \\\\u201cI don\\\\u2019t need you. I want you. But not if you are going to continue to act like this. So you leave the house and don\\\\u2019t come back until you are ready to make some changes.\\\\u201d She stuck to that too. He didn\\\\u2019t leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay. She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it and he left. She was fully prepared to be single again. They actually did end up working things out in the end.You can\\\\u2019t let someone stay and continue to treat you badly. Sure a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides. Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work. You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across and he may not realize how what he says does to you. A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt. But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries. That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you. Someone can\\\\u2019t do that if they are too scared to be alone. If they feel they need the other person in their life. These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents. When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family it is all they know. Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem you still don\\\\u2019t know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people. Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome. Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist. You can\\\\u2019t change your partner. Work on you and when you begin to heal and feel healthy the right people will come into your life and stay. The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become. END\",\"45\":\" I understand that gender and\\\\/or sexual identity crises can be very difficult to navigate although in today\\\\u2019s time I think we have made a lot of progress and it is becoming easier for individuals to find themselves and also find acceptance from society.I am unsure how old you are. If you are a child or teenager this is a normal time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life. I hope that you have understanding and supportive friends and family that you can talk to and who will support you in how you feel and what you may decide to do. A lot of people unfortunately do not and if this is the case then it makes it harder for you. Because then you may not feel safe exploring these feelings and decisions.I urge you not to try to make any permanent changes for quite some time. By this I mean a sex change. Anything permanent like surgery or hormone replacement to change your actual gender is something that does not need to be done lightly. Please find a therapist that can help you explore your feelings and your identity crisis. Of course there are things that you can do that are not permanent changes. Many people decide to dress like their gender of choice. Maybe experimenting in this way is something that you could do.See if you have a local chapter of PFLAG in your area. PFLAG stands for Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. They are able to help not only with those who identify as lesbian or gay but also transgendered and asexual. I wish you all the best in your identity crisis. It would be very easy for you to sink into depression if you do not have good support and understanding from those around you during this time. Find a professional that can help especially if you experience depression or any thoughts of harming yourself. END\",\"46\":\" The best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor and therapy to help you understand the thoughts feelings and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors. This is not something that anyone should just \\\\u201cwhite knuckle\\\\u201d and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept. A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change such as the recent death of a loved one a lost relationship or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped. In cases like this what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression. Other people seem to be able to handle life\\\\u2019s ups and downs and bounce back. They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. \\\\u201cYou are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made. You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes.\\\\u201d Another quote I like is \\\\u201cYou will find a way or you will find an excuse.\\\\u201d Don\\\\u2019t ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing but you do have choices. Not happy in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters to you you will find a way. Don\\\\u2019t sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better.Take care of yourself. Exercise is very important not only for your physical health but for your mental health as well. Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself. Also find a meditation that works for you. There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises visual and mental meditations and many many more. Start making some positive changes in your life today! You can do it! END\",\"47\":\" Do you have a close friend or relative who\\'s opinion you trust? Ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does. If they don\\\\u2019t see these qualities in you then it may be your cousin\\\\u2019s issue and she\\\\u2019s taking it out on you. You can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know specifically what she is expecting. Then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are it\\'s her issue and she is not coming from a place of love.Even if you do resemble her comments the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love. The fact that you\\'re introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you.  END\",\"48\":\" It sounds like you are in a tough situation. You have to ask yourself why you don\\'t want to leave her. Is it because of the child? Or is it because you want the relationship to work? You must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child. So if the abuse continues it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move out.On the other hand if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging. It seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship. Although your question revealed just a short bit of information I didn\\'t read about any positives in the relationship. Sometimes it\\'s extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you. However with time and focus you can do it. Each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your child.However if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship you have to be upfront with her. You need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you. This gives her a chance to render the situation. If after this there is no improvement I suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stay.I also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy. Are there any hobbies you enjoy? Are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents? Start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefit.It is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family. You need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend especially since this has not been a healthy environment lately.Thank you for reaching out. I wish you the best of luck with your relationship. END\",\"49\":\" More information would be needed for me to accurately answer this question such as your age whether you live with your dad or not and what other family members live in the household. Something like this alcoholism is a whole family disease. In other words family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior.First of all you can\\\\u2019t make your dad do anything and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse. Nobody can change another person. What you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him. Research codependency. There\\\\u2019s a great book called Codependent No More. There are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read. In short you have to stop enabling him. Like I said you cannot control him but you can control yourself. This means do not buy his alcohol. Do not make it easy for him to get. Don\\\\u2019t loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him. Don\\\\u2019t call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way. Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested. He needs to be responsible for himself. This may mean losing his job or losing his driver\\\\u2019s license. This may mean that he loses his family if he doesn\\\\u2019t stop. What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with. It is his choice to drink but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking. A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they don\\\\u2019t then they are getting a divorce.If you are an adult and you don\\\\u2019t live with your dad then the best thing you can do for him is STOP doing things for him. If you are a child who lives at home with him then this could be a case for child protective services. In my state this is called DHS. A report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect. Substance abuse in the home qualifies. Of course alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation there is no problems. The problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption. Does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated? Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state? Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking? This could be a reason for the authorities to step in. You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics. They are similar to the AA meetings that an alcoholic should go to but are for the family members. They can help you.  END\",\"50\":\" I think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family member\\'s wishes. Although everyone may not agree with one another the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction. There are many families that are united despite their differences. For example a mother may be Catholic and the father Jewish. By introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial. Also it\\'s not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences. So don\\'t get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues. Creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential.  END\",\"51\":\" I\\'m sorry to hear that you are feeling as if you\\'re in a slump. First of all nothing is wrong with you.

I think it would be best to talk with your doctor or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing them.It\\'s possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health issues.

In fact this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way if I do not get through the list I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day it is important you schedule work eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse\\\\/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there.

If there is a specific issue that you\\\\u2019d like to address in counseling let you doctor know about it.

END\",\"55\":\" Frequently when working with clients I utilize the A-B-C model developed by Albert Ellis the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Theory. The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an example:A (Action or Event): You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B (Behavior or Response): You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C (Consequence): You feel depressed.If you look at the model B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A then C will have a better consequence such as:A: stays the same.B (this is what you change): This person must be busy they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression &amp overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you I recommend &34Feeling better getting better staying better&34 by Alber Ellis. In addition looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone.

I recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future. If you find yourself becoming upset again I encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated.

Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken or perceived as being broken it takes a long time to repair. From what you shared it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since. Unfortunately no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive. If you feel confident in your relationship then trust your inner wisdom. We cannot control others but only ourselves. Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship. Good luck to you. END\",\"59\":\" Hey!

There are so many people putting forth their 100% everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve. Without being able to fully understand where you\\'re question is coming from I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this question.First I think it\\'s important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that you\\'re &34not good enough.&34 Is that ACTUALLY what they said or is this just what you heard? Sometimes because of our own self-doubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others. Again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective. Is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern? If so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time you\\'re spending on being &34good enough.&34 Explore with them how you feel you\\'r already giving your best.If the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship. Some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic. It may be they have their own &34stuff&34 going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better. If you\\'re in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well. Explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life. If it\\'s a relationship that MUST continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems. Until they\\'re willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation. Another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why it\\'s important for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals? NO ONE will ever be 100% &34good enough&34 for EVERYONE. Every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others. It would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives. The question becomes what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these expectations? There is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels &34less than&34 and feels as if you yourself are not good enough. It then becomes impossible to every feel &34good enough&34 for others because it\\'s really YOU you\\'re trying to feel good enough for. If you already feel as if you\\'re doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on LETTING GO of the rest. No one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress. Find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of what\\'s left. After all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrow!I recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection. The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation. I leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra &34No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. &34 - Eleanor Roosevelt.

This is called thought stopping. This is a technique to use to stop unwanted or unhealthy thoughts. Then I would like you to think of a more positive thought to replace it with such as: Negative thought: &34That girl will never go out with me&34 STOP Positive thought: &34I won\\'t know if she will go out with me unless I ask&34.

There are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern. First I think it\\'s important to understand food is just food. Food is meant to nourish our bodies provide us with energy and yes sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations. But in many cultures we place a LOT of emphasis on food. We have food at every gathering and every celebration. What\\'s more people have come to almost EXPECT food to be present at any and every get-together. And if it\\'s not? Well then forget about it! I see this time and time again with my clients. Donuts appear in the office and it\\'s almost like donuts have never been there before! Must eat one (or two)! However we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence or similar ones will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food. It is likely the office donuts have happened before and they will be there again on another day. During these moments I like to have my clients employ a Stop-and-Think method. Stop-and-Think about your goals before you eat. Is this donut getting you where you want to be? Also I have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut? If the donut really is a special donut (from the best bakery in town and you\\'ve never been there before) then now might be a time to have the donut. But if not it would be wise to pass and wait until that &34special&34 donut. Another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what we\\'re getting from overindulging or overeating. Are you trying to drown out other emotions? Are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment? What ELSE is going on? This can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a Thought Record. A Thought Record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers. By targeting the emotions we can then determine where they\\'re coming from as well as how to decipher them. A therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the Thought Record.The most important thing to remember is that &34food addiction&34 can be a real problem for a lot of people. If food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start please seek out help. Binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands. There are lots of free resources and information on my website at www.maddenwellnessky.com. In addition I offer individual coaching and counseling through my website and I would love to help!- Amber END\",\"96\":\" I would recommend removing yourself from the environment you are in after you have finished eating. A simple walk around the block calling up a friend and going to visit or even going to another room in the house can help. If you find that you truly have no self control over food I recommend attending Overeaters Anonymous a 12 step group for those with compulsive issues related to food. I hope this helps.  END\",\"97\":\" With any type of criticism it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time ie: when both of you are relaxed with no current stressors involved having fun etc. Begin with a non-judgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event as if it were just then crossing your mind (therefore not something you\\'ve been consumed with ruminating over - eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense mode).Then share how you felt at the time of the event. Just say when.... I felt kind of hurt \\\\/ shocked (or whatever the feeling was). PERIOD. THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY. Wait for him to respond to your matter-of-fact statement.No matter what his response is stick to your same message - don\\'t get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing.

Then allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the other.This is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focused.It is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeply.If the conversations don\\'t go very far or if your partner has no interest in talking stick with your own interest to more fully understand matters.Interview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation.

The feeling is of needing a partner in a way that is similar to how a fearful child needs staying nearby a parent.My suggestion is to think over how much your sense of need for a partner may be preventing you from actually seeing the amount of love and investment in your relationship your boyfriend actually has.These realizations are sometimes painful and frightening to understand especially if you grew up in a family that largely ignored or didn\\'t adequately nurture you as a child.A therapist for your Self may be a good investment of time and cost in giving yourself a safe and trustworthy space to think deeply about your best interest.

There is definite value in being clear as you are about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriage.Also positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you or not.Whether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other one.Is sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husband?Love and care are not enough to make a marriage work.Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other.That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband. It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship too.Decide how much emotional sadness and hurt you\\'re willing to tolerate and the reason you\\'re willing to do so.From what you write you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for this.If your husband doesn\\'t start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so.

Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety.Mindfulness based practices like meditation - maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition - can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment.

Mindfulness practices can help you ground be where you are  relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now - rather than worrying about what happens after you die.Having said all that - it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety - especially when you feel haunted by it worry that you are crazy and can\\'t get to sleep.

Some of your words tell me that you think you know what he\\'s thinking (that he wants to fight so he can leave that he thinks he\\'s perfect). It\\'s always tricky when we assume what someone\\'s thinking and in an argument or dialogue these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument.

As a general rule the When you do X I feel Y sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feel.So it\\'s fair to say when you lie to me I can\\'t trust you or when you end our date early to hang with your friends I feel like I\\'m not important to you or your mood swings are difficult for me or I don\\'t seem to get apologies from you.

Often when we feel we are required to prove ourselves feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive. In situations like this I often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner. Your fears about his response are valid as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact.If you feel comfortable doing so you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them. You can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses. In the end these are issues that you cannot conquer for him - you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust. You may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to as well. But in terms of your question only you can decide whether you feel you can remain in a relationship in which you defend yourself against an uncommitted offense.

If both of you are committed and willing to be fully honest with each other trust can be repaired and become stronger than ever.

When fear takes over - we tend to become defensive and act in ways that makes it harder to trust one another. In addition to getting professional support I would encourage you to learn more about building trust in relationships and deepening connection through accessing various online resources on relationships.

It sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you.

When we are going through this kind of loss it is really helpful to have the support of friends and family. While no one is going to be able to make it better we don\\'t have to be alone with our pain.

I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation. I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children.Children need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they don\\'t like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing. Your ex-boyfriendseems more focused on his own needs. In fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on \\'parental alienation\\'. I agree this is a problem.I also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy. It\\'s not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress. Honour this instinct you have.I will suggest a few things to you. First to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband. If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help. He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter. It will help you feel supported.Know that your ex\\'s behaviours aren\\'t happening because you did anything wrong it\\'s the way he operates (and maybe this is why you\\'re not with him?). You can\\'t change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression. You\\'re correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situation.Keep on defining clear boundaries! You might sound like a broken record (You\\'ll have to talk to my husband about that) but that\\'s okay. It\\'s okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle. It\\'s okay to not respond to texts or other communications that aren\\'t vitally important. It\\'s okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable. It\\'s okay to not engage with him more than is necessary.Regarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully. Let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing (our agreement states X and you are not following our agreement). Your daughter doesn\\'t have to be aware I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflict.A professional therapist can help you with all of this. I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself. :) END\",\"201\":\" Hi San Diego.I\\'m sad that this was your first experience (in 25 years) with feeling in love.

It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just don\\'t feel excited about him for some reason. That\\'s a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex.

Unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one. Kids fight for different reasons - wanting attention wanting respect feeling jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons. Regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them.These conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them. It is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong. The more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other.One exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding. This is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are. If this doesn\\'t work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict.

Have either one of you been in family therapy? This may be something you may want to suggest to your mom to help you both understand where each one is coming from.

Questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views are signs of strength and clarity in a person.As a therapist I always tell my patients to avoid anti-depressants.Their effectiveness is in suppressing a person\\'s mood and feelings. If someone does not know how they are feeling then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves their uncertainties and hesitations and overall how they relate to others and what they expect from others.Anti-depressants mask how someone feels.In a crisis temporarily taking anti-depressants may be helpful. If someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning then suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day may be of benefit for a short while.Basically respect and follow your own opinion about anti-depressants.  Your view is shared by many.  It is a minority opinion and very valid.If you would like to shop for a therapist ask the person on the phone what their opinions are about anti-depressants.Ideally you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematic.I hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search!

Well yes. And I consider your question as a mark of your sensitive awareness toward other people. Being able to recognize social dynamics is a strength that you have.Psychopaths know how to be charming and to twist words so that others believe that their own interest is the same as the psychopath\\'s.I agree with you about not being able to change people\\'s minds who are attached to this person\\'s interactions.The only way you can introduce a change in the relationship system of a psychopath is that if you are aware of illegal or law breaking activity and you have evidence of this that you contact relevant authorities.No one is allowed to break laws including psychopaths.

Typically by not reacting right away we are better able to gather our thoughts see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives and respond more calmly. One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing. When faced with a stressful situation you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths (breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6) while focusing and thinkingonly about your breathing. After doing so think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate. Good luck! END\",\"232\":\" I am very sorry for the pain you are suffering.

Regardless of whether or not you are sensitive it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you. When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed it is difficult to not take it personally. It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him. Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive? Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context. Begin your statements withI as opposed to you. For example you can tell him I feel angry whenyou raise your voice at me instead of Youalways yell at me. Also avoid using black and white terms such as never and always. Additionally offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you. Maybe he just doesn\\'t know how to.Lastly when delivering a message I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussionwith something postive and ending it with something postive. For example you may say something to the effect of:Dad Ienjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion. There are times thatI feel angry when you talk to me aggressively. Perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when I bring up heated topics. Let\\'s try and work on this together.

These modern ways of meeting people are awesome because we can be exposed to a wide variety of people who we never would meet in the grocery store or a friend\\'s party. There are complications though and one of the drawbacks is you can feel very connected to someone and care about them a great deal before you ever meet them in person. Then when you finally meet them and there isn\\'t that spark of magnetic physical attraction you\\'re in a bit of a difficult spot because you\\'ve already established that you\\'re drawn to each other in other ways you\\'re already connected.

In the future I suggest meeting up in person early on to answer that crucial question Are we physically attracted to each other?. Clearly this is not only important for you but it is for most of us.My guess is that you feel you owe this man your affection and commitment even though you\\'re not really all that into him (lusting after other men is a sign of that) because you like absolutely everything else about him. But honesty is crucial here both with yourself and this man. Just because you don\\'t find yourself attracted to him doesn\\'t mean that you\\'re a bad person or that he\\'s not attractive. Someone else might drool over him and I think he deserves someone who does just that. You can have both love and lust. For most people only one of them isn\\'t enough.

You don\\'t say whether you cheated or not. If you did then you might try taking an approach where you a) take responsibility for your past actions b) show an understanding of and compassion for his pain about that c) do everything you can to demonstrate trust and show that he is your priority and d) reassure him when he says he\\'s scared or feeling insecure. I\\'m suggesting that part of healing is you having tolerance of his emotions and demonstrating that you\\'re so confident you can be faithful that you can handle his moments of fear. This is what he and the marriage need in order to heal from the attachment injury.Part of the issue might be that when he brings it up he\\'s coming across as angry accusing or suspicious rather than scared and insecure. This often happens. A therapist can help both of you understand that fear is behind the anger and it works best if he shows you his vulnerable emotions rather than the anger (which is also natural but less helpful in those moments) and then you can more easily recognise the cue for you to reassure him.As much as you want to forget about it he might need to talk about it sometimes and that\\'s normal. His needs are important. Also important however is your need for respect. If he approaches it in a disrespectful way that\\'s a separate problem. If it\\'s brought up as a weapon used to shut you down or used to control or punish those are unhealthy ways of dealing with past hurts. You can both offer compassion to him and use your sense of boundaries to protect yourself from being flogged with the past.A qualified therapist can help you sort through this trick territory.

I would recommend having an open discussion with your husband about communication between the two of you in general. Do this during a time when there is little or no conflict and emotions are not heightened. Let him know how you feel and give him specific ideas of how you would like him to respond instead of saying enough. Additionally try and see his perspective and understand why he shuts you down. Perhaps he feels like he is being told what to do constantly or that he gets little positive feedback from you. An opendialogue about how to discuss issues going forward will likely help.

In regards to your coping behaviours at night it sounds very isolating and also very silenced. As opposed to the sad music why not try all music allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you. One of the other recommendations I would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way.Some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant though and I would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future.

In effect assertiveness communication becomes it\\'s own self-motivating force in managing positive self-esteem. You may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation.

We fear these things because they are so important - not because these fears are realistic or true!There is immense pressure put on young single people from peers and media to conform to ideas of what is normal and to meet expectations in terms of sexual experience dating etc. While some people may judge an adult who is a virgin - others will respect your choices and feel even more attracted to you because of your choices. Experimenting with sex so long as you are being safe and respectful is also completely okay and normal.Since expectations vary and we can\\'t be happy if we are always comparing ourselves to other people we need to ultimately trust that being who we are and building a loving relationship with ourselves is the key to meeting someone who will cherish us for all the ways that we are special and unique virgin or not. When we are able to really accept ourselves and trust in our loveableness (not a real word but you get what I mean!) then meeting someone special is simply a matter of time and effort - putting ourselves out in the world in situations where we are likely to meet other single people looking for relationships.When you are most afraid of being alone - remember that this fear is simply a reminder of how much you value relationships. Use that passion about wanting relationships to build the best relationship you can with yourself and then one day soon some lucky person will stumble into your life and benefit immensely from your passion and your ability to be authentically who you are rather than pretending to be normal or whatever that is anyway. Hope this helps! END\",\"305\":\" So wonderful to have a boyfriend who is able to understand and forgive you. What do you think that he sees in you that allows him to do that? Does he see someone who like other humans makes mistakes? Does he see someone who despite hurtful choices is a good person committed to being a loving respectful partner? The compassion and understanding that we can often extend to others can be difficult to extend to ourselves.We often hold very unrealistic and perfectionist expectations for ourselves which may even lead to our poor choices in the first place - as a ways of letting off steam or rebelling against our high standards. Regardless of the reasons we all make mistakes and imperfection does not make someone less loveable - it just makes them human. If your boyfriend is able to start clean with you there must be a reason.What you do from here on out will define the kind of partner you are to him. Can you treat him with the kind of respect that you would want? Can you help him to feel loved and safe in the relationship? Can you allow yourself to be imperfect and afraid and still worthy of love and acceptance. When you are feeling ashamed of your behaviours - try to imagine extending that scared part of you the same love and acceptance that you might extend to other people who have made mistakes. It is not easy to forgive ourselves but it is important in order to allow ourselves to be loved and to truly love others. END\",\"306\":\" Hi Winters I\\'m so glad you wrote because I think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing. You feel self-loathing for both being a virgin and for being sexually active. Young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what they\\'re supposed to be. They feel pressure to be pure and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually. But you can\\'t be both so you can\\'t ever win if you buy into all that horse manure (excuse my language).This current hook-up culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless. The stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship they feel guilt and loneliness. I urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings. My hope and prayer is that they will echo my words here.Your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you whether you turn his eye or how he treats you. Your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are and it is to be celebrated. I love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares. Who you are is so very much more than your sexuality. You sound like you have a lot of things going for you. Try to see all of those things when you think of yourself.There are many more virgins out there and many are afraid like you that they don\\'t fit in. We are all different and you don\\'t have to be anything but who you want to be who you are. You don\\'t have to have any kind of sex until you\\'re ready and that makes you brave and smart not weird.You\\'re tall and beautiful and guys may be intimidated by that. It may take time for you to meet the right guy but he\\'s out there. The question is: How do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path?I hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal. I wish you the best.

It doesn\\'t feel good to be angry all the time and it\\'s stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships I\\'m sure.Working with a therapist you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. It\\'s likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old tender bruised emotion that we\\'ve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions and anger is one way of doing that.So when someone looks at you in a certain way or says something you\\'d rather be angry than feel powerless or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). In that moment your instinct is to blame whatever happened no matter how small because that\\'s the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person\\'s face or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it\\'s that you can\\'t stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it\\'s on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with.

Forgiveness doesn\\'t have to mean what she did was okay. Not at all. Forgiveness can mean I accept what she did and I don\\'t want to live in her worst moments constantly. I want to put it down and move past it because I want her in my life because fear and resentment interfere with my relationship with her and mostly because I\\'m tired of carrying them (fear and resentment) around constantly.You can forgive your mom for yourself not for her.If there is evidence that your mom wants to respect you moving forward then it might be worth it to risk putting down the resentment and the grudge that you think you need to protect yourself.Your ability to draw boundaries with her in the present is your biggest protector let her know in the present what hurts you and notice her responses.You don\\'t have to say it to her face. Saying it to yourself is more important. Again forgiving your mom helps you...it reduces your own burden of fear and resentment leaving space for better things.

Fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope withlife\\'s obstacles including anger management. There are several strategies that you can try tohelp control your anger but theones thatI would recomend first are the following:1.Try a different way of communicating with your parents. Sincearguing withthem is a great source of anger for you learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit.Choose a time to talk with themabout heated issues when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened. Use I phrases by telling them how the arguments effect you as opposed to placing blame on them.Validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view.2. When you feel yourself becoming angry take a break. Simply excuse yourself from the situation find a quiet place to be by yourself and do some deep breathing. Close your eyes slowly count to four as you inhale and exhaleeven slower counting to 6. Focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes.3. Stop any negative thoughts in their tracks. Often times when we get upset we catastrophize and do not see things clearly. When you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational. If you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid then let them go and replace them with realistic logical thoughts.4. Finally find a friend or someone to talk to and\\\\/or keep a journal. Keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you. Being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angry.I wish you all the best! END\",\"317\":\" There are a few possibilities that might be keeping your boyfriend from talking about the future but the best way to find out for certain is to ask him. If your desire is to have a permanent relationship with your boyfriend two years should be plenty of time for him to determine whether or not he also wants this and if not yet he should be able to give you a reason why.People who drag their feet in the area of commitment sometimes do so because they fear commitment itself and the thought of permanency is terrifying to them. Such fears might be grounded in past failed relationships past history of abuse or neglect or just pure selfishness and a related fear of what they might have to give up in a relationship.Another common reason for people to avoid talking about permanency is because there are things in the relationship that they feel may need to change before the relationship becomes more committed. Financial and career issues are common reasons for postponing commitment. Other issues may have to do with taking care of other family responsibilities such as raising children from previous relationships.The most important thing to remember I think in managing your own feelings in this relationship is that you have the right to ask questions and to have a conversation about your future. You are part of this relationship and you deserve to know what types of barriers are there that prevent this relationship from becoming permanent. True love needs to be grounded in truth.Good luck to you!  END\",\"318\":\" The first step to change is to admit that you have a problem that is in need of change. Frequently our problems keep us in denial. Although feeling hopeless is an uncomfortable feeling it suggests to me that you know that you can not do this alone. The best course of treatment for you is to treat all of these problems together. Alcohol detox can be very dangerous so it is important that you do this under the supervision of a medical provider preferably someone who specializes in addiction. Know also that although marijuana may not appear to be as big as a problem as alcohol is it will cause you to have an increase in alcohol cravings so complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol is needed.I really recommend an inpatient stay for at least 30 days for anyone who is dealing with addiction whether combined with mental health issues or not. If this is not a possibility then the next best thing would be an Intensive outpatient program that treats both addiction and mental health issues. Know that there is hope for what you are experiencing. You can get control over these issues. The next step is finding the team and\\\\/or facility that is going to help you do it.

Generally the non-profit sectors offer sliding scale fees and if you qualify your cost per session would be financially comfortable for you.One possibility is to tell your parents that you\\'d like starting therapy because of feeling so much stress from the family arguing.They may very well be surprised to learn of your maturity in assessing your level of stress and be willing to make a positive contribution to this by offering to authorize therapy through their health insurance.They may even decide on family counseling so all of you work together to relate in more loving ways.Last if you aren\\'t ready to speak with your parents about wanting counseling think about speaking to your school guidance counselor.

This happens quite a bit...a couple will be very much in love but with time it becomes more and more clear that there is a barrier to moving forward to deeper intimacy and commitment. You don\\'t provide details but I will give you what my best hunch is about what might be happening here.A few possibilities...it\\'s possible that he\\'s not as in love as he says. Some people find it hard to be honest about these things. There\\'s no way to tell for sure but look for signs that he\\'s not all that into this relationship even though he says he is. It\\'s also possible he\\'s just not ready to commit long term and if that\\'s the case he could say so and help you understand this. I think it\\'s more likely though that he\\'s very in love with you but has an emotional barrier to moving forward.For you it\\'s simple...you love him and want to plan a future. For him it\\'s not so simple though. I believe your boyfriend probably loves you very much but there is something else preventing him from being able to plan a future with you. He\\'s likely scared about something (scared he\\'s not good enough or that he\\'ll be hurt) and that fear makes him avoid commitment and deep intimacy. His fears have nothing to do with you they are based on his own emotional history. It\\'s a barrier that doesn\\'t become evident until intimacy is already established. Getting close to someone triggers our deep fears. He can get close but only so close.It\\'s really important you know this isn\\'t your fault there\\'s no other person out there who will have a magic key to make him want a future with them. It\\'s not about you at all.There are a few ways that this can go. If he recognises this barrier and wants to change it he can try therapy to address his emotional barriers. That\\'s up to him and only him. If you send him to therapy he might resent that. Couple therapy may help but a couple therapist may also recommend he do some individual exploring first.For you it will be helpful to simply be aware of your own needs in a relationship. If as a couple you keep hitting this wall of his over and over again that\\'s going to be painful. You may eventually decide that you need a partner with a stronger ability to commit long term. There\\'s nothing essentially wrong with the way he is it\\'s just not a good match for you because you have a different pace in a relationship. Let him know what you need (some security for the future of your relationship. If you want to or plan to have children this is a natural thing to want)...and then see if he can give it to you.So do some thinking first then go to him not in anger (he\\'s just being himself after all and anger won\\'t help) but with your dilemma. I love you and I want a partner to plan a future with. Can you do that with me?. Then you see what happens. :) END\",\"325\":\" Hi Bend You\\'re scared right? That makes sense. Each time we have a break-up we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business. We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and there\\'s a vulnerability in that we can get hurt. Who you partner with long-term is a big decision and it determines 90% of our happiness in life.The good news is that when we\\'re just starting to get to know someone we can take it slow.

So part of what I want to say here is don\\'t pressure yourself too much. Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow. :)As well there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down or will come down for the right person.First think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship. What do you feel proud of? What do you need in a partner? What mistakes did you make? Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partner.Look at your thoughts. Are you having generalized negative thoughts like No one will ever love me again? or I\\'m going to get hurt again or I can\\'t trust myself? If so write down what these thoughts are and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts. Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening!! It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence. Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought. What is the evidence that I am lovable... that there are safe good people out there... that I can trust myself? Eliminate the negative thoughts and add the positive ones. It\\'s simple but very powerful.Lastly take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls. What is the evidence of the walls? Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls? When we act as though something is true we start to feel it and believe it more.I hope you will find yourself back on track eventually with time. :) END\",\"326\":\" Hello.

If either are the case please visit a psychiatrist for an accurate assessment.I believe you asking for some support in order to quiet your reactive mind (also called self-talk automatic thoughts mind talk etc.) When anxious these thoughts tend to start racing. The battle inside heats up even more when you start judging the thoughts themselves. It sounds like the idea of the racing thoughts is giving you extra stress and you have created a feedback loop. In CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) there are some excellent BEHAVIORAL interventions to break free. Start by doing behaviors that are distracting fun and healthy such as calling a friend going to a movie or getting some exercise. You may also do behaviors that slow your heart rate like deep breathing and yoga. It\\'s amazing how well slowing the body can slow the mind. There are many other behavioral techniques for calming the mind. Pick up a mindfulness meditation book for more ideas.Then there is the COGNITIVE aspect of your question. This is the idea of recognizing how the thoughts are distorted and to challenge them rationally. For example if you do some of the behaviors just mentioned and you get some benefit your stated idea that it never stops may not be accurate. And your comments that the thoughts are weird or crazy are arbitrary judgments that you are making against yourself. These are examples of cognitive distortions. By challenging them you may slow down the chatter inside your head.Of course my book LIVING YES A HANDBOOK FOR BEING HUMAN is filled with ideas for both behavioral and cognitive improvement. I evan have a chart (p. 57) which shows the different characteristics of the worldly voice and the sacred voice inside. Learn more about Living Yes at www.LivingYes.org.

Then what happens is because we have that connection established we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we don\\'t have to work hard to earn their love anymore.

It\\'s as though you filled the car with gas you\\'ve run out of gas now and you\\'re forgetting to put more in!The first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that you\\'ve cut back on. Act lovingly and you will likely regain those feelings. Talk to your partner about this. It\\'s okay to say do you remember we used to do XY and Z? Can we do that again?

And I\\'m talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices so she can see her power.

You can say ipad time is over. If you put it down you can play later. If I have to take it away you don\\'t play it later. The choice is hers.

You\\'re simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it.Staying calm yourself is the key because then at least you will feel in control of yourself which is the ultimate goal. Use self-talk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted and it will be over by the time the breath is done.

If you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over. I would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time until you figure out what is going on. I encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations if any about being sexually active. Do you fear pregnancy? Are there problems in the relationship? Are you afraid of the emotional intimacy?Another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way.  When these types of traumatic events occur people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma. Such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with. If this is the case I strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues.A final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration. If so I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems. Although pain can also be associated with emotional issues it is always good to rule out possible physical causes. I hope that these ideas help to point you in the right direction. Take care.

One general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe. The more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking isolated physical surroundings and being in isolated locations with someone with whom you\\'re not very familiar probably your fear will decrease.The other general direction to understand is if in your family history people have been violated severely either emotionally mentally or physically.In families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generation.Its possible then that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own suffering.The good news is that individual therapy with a credentialed and licensed therapist is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden.

There are also several actions you can take on your own to help control your anger and communicate more effectively.Here is what I would recommend you try: Take time outs: When you feel yourself becoming upset excuse yourself and take a time out to either think about the most appropriate course of actionor redirect your thoughts all together. Often when webecome angry it is difficult to see the issue clearly as our emotionsget in the way. Do deep breathing exercises: Close your eyes. Breathe in slowly to the count of 4. Breathe out even slower to the count of 6. Practice this for about 5 minutes 3 times a day and focus on nothing except your breathing during this time. Once it becomes routine for you it will be easier to apply during situations in which you are angry or upset. Change negative thought patterns: Try and recall or be aware of your thoughts particularly when you are feeling angry. What are these thoughts telling you? Are they valid or logical? Is there factual evidence to support the negative thoughts? Often the answer is no. Learn to stop the negative thoughts and replace them with logical andmore positive ones. Communicate effectively: As a speaker you want to use I statements by telling the other person how you feel instead of blaming him\\\\/her by using you statements. For example you might say something such as I feel sad when you don\\'t come home at a decent hour and I don\\'t get to spend time with you versus You always stay out late and don\\'t even care about me. The speaker should also avoid using black and white language such as always never etc. As the listener you want to validate what you hear so that the other person knows that you are listening. You will also want to be responsive and offer fair solutions. I wish you luck in using these tools and learning about where your anger comes from.

It is very possible for you to learn different ways of relating with some strong effort. I would highly suggest working with a therapist and I will give you a few things to think about in the interim.Sometimes anger is there because we feel something is unjust or unfair but many times anger is a secondary emotion and it\\'s simply there to protect us from other more vulnerable emotions that we would rather not feel and will do anything to avoid. Discovering what vulnerable emotions you are protecting yourself from is important. Perhaps you feel powerless or unloved or unimportant. It may take some time before you recognise this emotion.Once you do you can ask yourself about the other times in your life when you have felt that emotion. Where did it originate? At what age did you feel too much of that feeling...so much so that you can\\'t stand it even in tiny amounts?You will learn in therapy to identify the thoughts you have that are connected to that feeling. They are typically incorrect thoughts like No one lifes me or People will always hurt me. Fear tends to generalize and predict bad things that aren\\'t likely.Your habit is so strong that you likely have a poor sense of self-worth and you don\\'t believe people will love you...so you hurt them to keep them at a distance. This happens in a subconscious level. Do you see how that would help you to keep people off balance or afraid or a distance away if you didn\\'t believe in your worth? So it\\'s backwards really because you think you\\'re getting mad at people who piss you off but you\\'re really just not wanting to face how mad you are at yourself.In addition to this work you can start to purposely treat people more kindly. Find out what respect is make amends and resolve to spreading peace. It might sound too simple but if you act as though you\\'re a person of peace you will start to feel more peaceful.But I hope you do contact a therapist. It will take time and support to reach your goal. END\",\"371\":\" Hi Enid You sound like a sensitive parent I like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong. There is some key information here (I don\\'t know your son\\'s age whether he spent any money whether he put the card back or how many times he\\'s stolen) and my answer might be different depending on those details but I\\'ll give you my thoughts.I see it as every child\\'s job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world. In order to accomplish that many of them test limits. What can I get away with? is a question they have to find the answer to. If a child knows the rules they\\'re much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). So part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. Not all kids steal but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point. It\\'s a normal behaviour and most of the time it\\'s about small things that don\\'t matter and we don\\'t even find out.Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious and I\\'m not surprised he lied about it. If you absolutely know that he took it it\\'s okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. It\\'s appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour so that the child doesn\\'t do it again. The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. The behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea.It\\'s funny because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad but they know they\\'ll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we don\\'t want people to know our mistakes). It\\'s a dilemma. If you really want to focus on the lying part you can tell him that you won\\'t give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. That gives him incentive to come to you with truth. It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth.You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. Put a cookie on the counter. Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. Then ask them later if they took the cookie. You\\'re making honesty fun. Kids love games.Basically there\\'s as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative.If this is the first serious offence for your son don\\'t make a big deal of it consequence him and see if he learns. If it\\'s a pattern that\\'s different and you may want the input of a therapist.

END\",\"376\":\" Hi AtticaThis is a question I think a lot of people deal with...they feel confusion about why they can\\'t forget about or get over (or stop connecting with) someone who they absolutely know isn\\'t good for them.In your case part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you. For some people honestly it\\'s a game... to see how much power they have over you or it\\'s their need to control you. If you don\\'t want contact from this person it\\'s really important to give him clear messages about boundaries (Don\\'t contact me again) and then ignore all of their communications. Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. Remind yourself why you don\\'t want to be with them. I hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me. That\\'s great self-talk.But let\\'s get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. Sometimes it\\'s because we still hope they will change. Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days. The problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less. So what they\\'re eventually showing you is who they are and what they\\'re capable of. People do change and grow but it won\\'t happen at your pace. Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change.Another reason we can\\'t let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. This is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. It\\'s as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes. You deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasn\\'t demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy.It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someone\\'s poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. It will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behaviours.Draw a line. Their behaviours are about them not you and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them and create physical and emotional distance. These things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance. END\",\"377\":\" Hello Vancouver It\\'s really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes. The small thing is a trigger and the emotions aren\\'t so much about that event that\\'s happening in the present they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling.

Look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke. If there\\'s anger there look underneath that.

As a child maybe but not necessarily.That\\'s the first step and combined with empathy compassion and self-esteem you\\'re starting to build what I call an emotional air conditioner.

What strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtful\\\\/abusive\\\\/controlling with you and then you ask Should we call it quits?. We? I wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours rather than yours together.The way your husband treats you is not your fault Texas. Your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you. The problem is not your lying. The problem is that you don\\'t feel safe enough to be honest with a person you\\'re supposed to be able to trust.There\\'s an analogy that I sometimes use I don\\'t know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story but it\\'s powerful either way so I will tell it to you.If you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water the frog will jump out immediately knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot it will die. If you take a frog however and put it in a pot of cold water and slowly slowly heat it to boiling the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises it\\'s dying it has lost its strength.It\\'s called learned helplessness. When your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time you get used to that and you fail to see the options that are available to you.You have a toddler and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child. In my experience and what research backs up is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy. You are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse.This is a complex picture and if you were my client I would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where you\\'re seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions but I do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child.I sincerely hope you seek professional help with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist.

That\\'s a huge barrier to happiness that you can work to reduce. I\\'ll get you started.You feel shame in a debilitating way that is probably way out of proportion to the incident. Is it triggering some old shame?Unfortunately a lot of adults use shame as a motivator for kids. It doesn\\'t work. Whenwas the first time you remember feeling a lot of shame as in I\\'m bad orI\\'m worthless? Is there a younger version of you who is still feeling shame over something that wasn\\'t your fault? Sometimes shame shadows are connected to an absent or hurtful parent sexual abuse or some family loss or trauma.If so picture yourself at that age. Can you tell your child self that whatever horrible thing happened to them isn\\'t their fault? Can you have compassion for that child who first felt shame or had shame heaped on them?That\\'s your first goal...to go to the source of the shame and heal that child\\'s wound with compassion. What happens to children is never their fault (and fault is a pretty useless concept anyway).Once you take the layers of old I\\'m bad shame off the load is lighter and you can use self talk to further reduce the shame. Here are some things you can say to yourself...every day...I\\'m human and that\\'s okay. I don\\'t have to be perfect.I can have compassion for my mistakes.I can feel proud that I\\'m facing my mistake and making things right.I deserve forgiveness and compassion and I have that for other people too.There\\'s no purpose to holding on to shame.I can learn from my mistakes and move forward.Everyone makes mistakes.Other people don\\'t want me to carry this shame around.I don\\'t need shame to remind me not to do it again.

END\",\"408\":\" Hi TexasOh that\\'s a powerful idea isn\\'t it? It burrows into your head. Let\\'s figure this out. First has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? Have they cheated before? If not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. If it\\'s a yes then it\\'s natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that you\\'re hiding something. I need openness. If they haven\\'t cheated on you in the past there are three possible scenarios here. I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. What is the specific thing that\\'s triggering your fears? When you have your data recorded read on...The first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you\\'ve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you\\'re not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons not because we\\'re not interesting). This may be true if what you wrote down is They didn\\'t really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. I\\'m just scared and suspicious. That\\'s a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened. I can trust.If what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or you\\'re having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. Trust your gut but your gut isn\\'t seeing evidence of cheating...it\\'s evidence of something. Ask your partner what\\'s up with accusations or assumptions.The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. Maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw. I\\'d say when there is some evidence it\\'s okay to present this to your partner and ask what\\'s going on. If this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don\\'t make sense then it\\'s okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of what\\'s going on around you.I hope that helps.

Negative self-talk leads to increased disinterest and eventually tasks not being completed. It is great that you recognize that you have the tendency to not complete tasks that you start. Some questions that would be great to explore with a therapist are:how often you start and stop tasks without completing them?how you are feeling when you choose to start\\\\/ stop a project\\\\/task?how many tasks do you complete?

How to stop abusing alcohol involves a few steps most of them time consuming with slow progress and very often with tremendous emotional pain.The basic path is to figure out what motivates you to drink too much and be addicted to weed. Almost always addictions are rooted in the person having suffered feeling deeply ignored humiliated shamed invisible nothing very pleasant since a very young age usually starting around 18 months.Most often addicts are sensitive people who have been emotionally overburdened by the grownups in their family.With no outlet for emotional expression or nurturing the frustration goes inward until the emotional pain feels very big and without an outlet.So people mask and numb by substances whether this is food chocolate work alcohol weed.Therapy that is humanistic based is a better fit than one which is drug oriented and diagnosis oriented.If you\\'d like getting serious about knowing who you are including any unfair treatment of you during your growing up years you can do this.Once you have a stronger self-respect and awareness you would naturally avoid substances because they harm people. Harming oneself is the opposite of self-respect.Also about your diagnosis it may not be true at all. the US healthcare system loves selling drugs to people and clinicians in agencies and clinics are encouraged to find something wrong with people in order to find a new customer who will take drugs.See if you can find a therapist who is independent minded and therefore free to interact therapeutically with you as a human being not as a potential customer if they are able to label you as having something wrong.This simply continues the long line of being shamed by others that created the addiction problem in the first place.Good luck!

I get to make my own decisions and you can\\'t stop me might be it. Underneath that maybe it\\'s I want to stop but I\\'m ashamed that I can\\'t and I don\\'t want you to see my failures. Ultimately as an adult he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has you are pretty certain to get some fallout... pushback...backlash... How does his drinking affect you? That\\'s where your voice has power rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie (when he\\'s passed out asking if he\\'s been drinking seems confusing). You\\'ve mentioned snoring which I guess is a legitimate complaint. If he\\'s passing out that\\'s a legitimate complaint. When he drinks does he drive act aggressively or \\'check out of\\' the relationship (avoid you)? All of these things are legitimate concerns and I\\'d stick to talking about those rather than counting beers.

END\",\"416\":\" Hi ArkansasYour situation sounds like a case of parental alienation. Your ex-partner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you. It\\'s a form of woman abuse and child abuse. He\\'s likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you and he\\'s not considering how it\\'s affecting the kids. I\\'ve seen this happen in many families parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent. In some cases children actually stop having contact with one parent who is left bewildered and powerless. It\\'s your ex\\'s job to support your relationship with your kids not try to destroy it.While you can\\'t change his behaviours and I think you know that there are things you can do for yourself and your kids.For your children you can refuse to enter into the war he\\'s setting up. He\\'s trying to provoke you into acting crazy but you don\\'t have to fall for this. If you run around screaming he\\'s lying! it only makes you look more \\'crazy\\'. Try to stay calm and don\\'t put their dad down to them no matter how tempting it is. One day they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask. Trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he doesn\\'t have the power to destroy their love for you. Children in the long term lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent. They see who their dad is already I\\'d bet but they don\\'t know how to cope with that. If he\\'s the only one fighting a war you\\'re helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict. Don\\'t engage on his level.Don\\'t blame your children completely. Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you don\\'t need to tolerate that disrespect try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it. They are acting out their father\\'s agenda likely because they instinctively see his weakness. Children often support the weaker parent rather than abandon them. You get the worst because they trust your love. But you can still have boundaries. Letting them abuse you isn\\'t the answer but have compassion for their position. This picture isn\\'t their fault but as adults they can be held accountable for their choices.Reassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are. You don\\'t need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices. Hold onto the likelihood that some day they will come back and be grateful. It may take a while you can\\'t rush it but they will see you for who you are. Your power is in giving them a consistently calm generous connected supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on.I\\'d recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded.

You\\'ve been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh but really you\\'ve not been grieving...you\\'re stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let\\'s look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there\\'s something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn\\'t have the chance to say so or you felt you hurt her and you didn\\'t have the chance to make it right. Maybe there\\'s a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you\\'ve never stopped loving her and see if she feels the same way.

If you reach out there\\'s no guarantee it will go well or that she\\'ll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don\\'t send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide.Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance or are there more differences between you that didn\\'t work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can\\'t clearly see that the other person isn\\'t in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she\\'s asked for distance you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they\\'re getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or If I move forward that will mean... Keep going...what would be the worst part of that? This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you\\'ve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in If this person doesn\\'t love me then I\\'m unlovable or No one will ever love me as much as she did. So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It\\'s part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that\\'s how I know I\\'m lovable.It\\'s normal to feel sad.

Or maybe you have spoken to him about it. If so what happens? Does he listen and help you understand him better? Or does he avoid and reassure you...or maybe dismiss you? This is really important data to gather about how your fiance handles conflict and how you work together.He says leave me alone. That\\'s a pretty bold statement about what he wants. He doesn\\'t seem to have the same idea that you do about what marriage is and how close you want to be. Plus I have to say those words sound more like what a closed-off fourteen year old would say to a parent than a loving fiance to his bride to be!Giving him the benefit of the doubt it could be that your fiance is scared about getting married and this is a temporary reaction that will change. But if this is true he needs to tell you that so you can understand.So I suggest that the fact that when you\\'re together you\\'re okay is perhaps not the best barometer for how you\\'re doing as a couple. Listen to your gut. I encourage you to be really open with your fiance about what your feelings and fears are. This may get rockier before it gets better but until you face what\\'s not working you won\\'t know who you truly are as a couple. When you\\'re engaged it\\'s a really cool time to see a therapist too...to get some conflict resolution skills down before you\\'re a married couple.

No one can really disconnect from reality every day on which they wake up.Instead of trying to do the impossible which is promoted online and in media allow yourself time to recognize what went into creating a problem in your life in the first place. Understanding problems leads to peacefulness and resolution. Then you will have more freedom to make new relationships.Also be patient with this process and yourself.If you have deep attachment to painful situations in your life then possibly now is your time for understanding what went wrong.This is a process which cannot be rushed if it is to be done well.If it is done thoroughly then you very naturally will bring new relationships into your life.And life will no longer feel so painful that you can only manage one day at a time without hurting.

Eventually you stop chasing him and you drift further apart.It\\'s a bit of a conundrum...how to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities. Maybe lower your expectations for a bit? Your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears and you would need to hold onto the fact that he\\'s really scared and that he\\'s not rejecting you...just protecting himself.I would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like Sweetheart we both know that something\\'s not right here.

You don\\'t have to put yourself in a slot. Our sexual preferences are more fluid than we think and it can change over time.We also live in a culture where there is prejudice against homosexuality or differentness in general.

If this is what your parents siblings and extended family believe it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and haven\\'t yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of living.Give yourself the time to browse around online or in person social meet ups on your interests.

Wheninitiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive there are a few things that you want to remember.Tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong. Avoidusing extreme black and white language (i.e. always and never).For example you may say something such as I feel confused that we are rarely intimate and I\\'m wondering if you\\'ve also noticed this change versus You are never intimate with me anymore.Don\\'t be afraid to ask him questions. You deserve to know what is going on as his behavior is effecting your well being. I like to ask open-ended questions instead of yes and no questions. It allows formore clarity and deeperexplanation.

I\\'d like to throw in a technique I learned from Randy Rausch (author ofThe Last Lecture)called The 3-Step Apology. I teach this important bit of wisdom to my clients when they need to apologize to someone else but more importantly when they need to forgive themselves.Yes when we have trouble forgiving ourselves we sometimes forget that there is part of us that just doesn\\'t know how to apologize effectively. Here goes:Step One: Say what you did and the damage it caused.Step Two: Say you\\'re sorry and accept full responsibility (no excuses no explanation no defensiveness: \\\\u201cIt was all my fault.\\\\u201d)Step Three: Ask what you can do to repair the damage.Step Three is the one many of us didn\\\\u2019t learn growing up. And when we add it to an apology we are usually surprised that the penalty is as light as it is. Of course sometimes the apology is not accepted and no way to atone is offered. So be it we can\\\\u2019t control this. But if we are apologizing to ourselves we can. There is always a way to make amends if we put our heart into it.

Through research we know a lot of things about how to reduce anxiety. I\\'ll get you started and it\\'s a great idea to connect with a therapist who can build on these ideas and get to know you well.It\\'s natural to have random thoughts that unsettle us. Our brains are complex wonderful things. Fearful and anxious thoughts are a part of this picture their purpose is to prepare us for the future and to help us make sense of the past and learn from it. But what happens sometimes is that our alarm systems get out of whack and get set off too easily. We often spend TOO MUCH time worrying about things that happened or might happen. When these thoughts take away from our enjoyment of life it becomes a problem. So while fear and anxiety try to protect us they also seek power and will take any power they can get.In general fear and anxiety try to tell us one or both of two things: that something is wrong with us or that something bad will happen (or that something bad will happen because there\\'s something wrong with us). They will use anything they can as evidence to convince you. For example... That person looked at you funny. You\\'re strange looking. Well there are dozens of possible explanations for the look on that person\\'s face and it\\'s unlikely it had anything to do with you.For you personally your thoughts are about the afterlife...about living forever. What does fear tell you will be uncomfortable about living forever? What would the worst part be? A therapist would help you dig deep to find the core of what you fear. It might be that you have no control over who you are or where you go. It might be that you fear going to hell because you\\'re bad. Search for that deepest fear.I invite you then to picture that thought as a glass of water on a shelf. It\\'s a heavy glass and if you held it in your hands for a while and stared at it it would get in the way you\\'d be uncomfortable and unable to focus on your life. That\\'s what\\'s happening now. I suggest that the problem is not so much the thought you\\'re having we all have random silly thoughts that usually aren\\'t true. The problem is how long you\\'re holding it in your hand. You could have that thought (pick up that glass) a hundred times a day and as long as you put it right back on the shelf it\\'s not a problem. The trick is to get it back on that shelf.Right now you\\'re using distraction to do this. You\\'re trying to focus on other things around you but I think the glass is still in your hand. It\\'s not enough you\\'re looking for more tools to get that glass back on the shelf. And the key is in your thoughts. Once you find out what fear is trying to tell you then you can talk back to fear. So as an example if fear is saying to you you have no control over anything then you can work to accept the pieces you don\\'t have control over learn to tolerate that feeling and claim back the pieces you CAN control. You CAN control the extent to which you let fear take you over.With a therapist you can learn to refute fears\\' ideas. You can learn to look for concrete evidence of fear\\'s lies and gain back control over your thoughts. I wish you the best! END\",\"478\":\" In dealing with an eating disorder you are far from alone.

A child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesn\\'t necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution.Some questions... Was the parent harmful to the child? Is the parent likely to be harmful to the child? How likely is it to be a positive experience? Do you have any contact with the parent? You may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen. I would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind. What does he want to get out of a visit with the parent? Is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved...? What does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit? There are many possible goals this child might have in mind. This will give you a sense of what\\'s missing for the child what need are they trying to fill.

Let her be in charge of the sex for a while to take the pressure off and she can have the time to figure out what gets in the way of having regular sexual intimacy in your relationship. If you think of this as my wife is in crisis and needs support in figuring this out it can help you manage your own emotions.Pressure to have sex might push her further away. Did the couple therapist help you to see the dynamic in your relationship? Has your partner identified something she feels she is lacking in the relationship? One good way to make sure you get is to give (and I mean give what she wants not sex).It\\'s appropriate to say to her now I cannot live in a relationship with so little intimacy. I need for you to be honest with me about what you want for us sexually. If this is all you want I\\'m not sure I can do it. If you want us to be more sexual I need you to address what gets in the way for you. Give her some time help her in any way you can and then see where you are. See if she does seek help to address an issue that is hers.Then...you have a decision to make. I encourage you to make it looking at the big picture not just the sex.

According to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this. When a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better. If a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form (addiction) that would utilize this new behavior. Another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens a positive reward for a behavior even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences. Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes in this case sadness or depression and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist) and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior.

On the flip side it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives and 3. something YOU created.

This means that typically after you binge you experience emotions as you described shame and disappointment and then because of these emotions you repent (i.e. vow to never binge again promise to do better go to the gym etc.) and then ultimately end up bingeing again.There are many coping mechanisms for binge eating and one of the best is actually attempting to NORMALIZE eating. Meaning you need to attempt to eat normally eating appropriately portioned meals 3 times a day with snacks in between. IF you binge then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating then this actually leads to a binge again. Thus reverting you back to the cycle. If you binge it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge. Although it may feel counterproductive getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle.It can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past. Focus on what you can do differently next time. What emotions or situations led up to the binge? What can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge or the way that you handled the situation?Lastly if you\\'re struggling with normalizing eating it can be helpful to work with a professional that can provide counseling and coaching to help you learn how to eating normally mindfully and without feeling the guilt and other harmful emotions sometimes associated with disordered eating.

Instead of avoiding or withdrawing from these feelings remain present and fully experience the symptoms of anxiety. Instead of avoiding distressing thoughts open up to them in an effort to realize and acknowledge that they are not literally true.Although it may seem counter-intuitive fully realizing the experience of anxiety enables the release of over identification with negative thoughts.

Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation engaging in deep breathing exercises yoga practice or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive self-talk when feeling down or when anxious. For example: I don\\'t need to worry I am calm and relaxed. 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example: leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people. However the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills (ex. deep breathing) the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful.

If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up. People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember.

You grow up gradually and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance. I\\'m all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom.Ultimately you only have control over yourself so that\\'s the place to start. You can remind yourself that Mom\\'s behaviours don\\'t mean that she doesn\\'t trust you or love you it\\'s just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range. If you can see her responses as habits rather than a reflection of how she feels about you then you can keep yourself calm. The more calm you are the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship.Take a look at the picture from her perspective. She may feel overwhelmed with finances (are you in college?) and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she doesn\\'t know how to recruit help for. I bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you cleaning cooking doing laundry...all those thankless mom tasks. Take a look at how she talks to you... is she nagging about chores? Can you see that underneath the nagging there\\'s a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance? Okay so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef. She wants help. You want respect. Let\\'s talk about how you get both.I propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic. Mom...I see us as stuck in how we interacted when I was fourteen. Can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want? Sell it as win-win. Then you write down some things that end up forming a contract.The first part is stuff that\\'s your business and your business alone: things you want your mom to respect like your room your school your job your personal relationships and hygiene.... Mom\\'s voice has no place in these arenas unless you are storing food in your room and it\\'s a health hazard. This is a Mom says nothing about list.The second part is about what Mom needs from you. What are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult. Does she want you to contribute to rent? Buy your own food? Do your own laundry? What items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of Mom? How will these things be enforced? What will happen if you don\\'t follow through? Write it all down so it\\'s really clear. It has to all be mutually agreed upon.The third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you and how you talk to her. You can let her know that you don\\'t want to be told what to do or when to do it that doesn\\'t work when you\\'re 20 years old. Listen to what she wants too. Beyond the contract you\\'ve just written up anything else you want from each other is a request it\\'s optional and whether and when you do it is at your discretion. My guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect you\\'d be more willing to help out. AND I think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less. Go for the win-win.I wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with Mom. :) END\",\"539\":\" The other two post answers to your question are very good and I don\\'t feel the need to repeat what has already been said quite well but I will offer one other option I have been able to utilize quite successfully with those dealing with panic attacks. Chain analysis is a fantastic way for your to map out the situation starting with the prompting event the chain of events ((links) that lead up to the behavior - in this case a panic attack and then what the consequences were. See the illustration below:This is very useful in that it lays everything out for you to see so that it becomes possible to alter one of the links leading up to the unwanted behavior (panic attack) allows you to come up with strategies for similar situations (prompting events) and allows you to understand how you are reinforcing the behavior when it does occur (consequences). Finally - it would also allow you to identify any particular vulnerabilities such as not enough sleep poor nutrition trauma history or having a cold the time it occurred.Working with someone who utilizes a behavioral approach such as DBT or behavioral analysis you can find solutions that replace one of the links and therefore breaks the chain of events.

Most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for 5-6 free counseling sessions (your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them). Secondly I would advise you to take a minute and breathe. When confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama but sometimes that can compound our stress. When dealing with stress it is important that you engage in self care. In other words find time to engage in activities that bring you a sense of peace enjoyment and fulfillment in order that you may get a momentary release from your daily hectic life.

I would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a Cognitive Behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior. In addition I would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed. The first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing which you have now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion and communicate that you\\'re angry.

I worked for a number of years with people who have been both abused in their relationships and those who have been abusive. Being involved in a relationship with a partnerwho does the behaviorsyou describe can be incredibly difficult and many would argue is even harder thanovercoming actual physical violence. I was a little confused about whether you\\'re are still broken up with this person or if you are still thinking about it. I am going to assume you are still undecided. Some of the things you are describing sound like emotional abuse. Even without physical abuse being emotionally abused can still be traumatizing. When partners question and accuse they are often trying to exercise power and control over their partners by hurting them with unfounded accusations. The accusations serve to make someone feel guiltyand to manipulate them. For example if your partner accuses you of cheating when you go out bowling with friends you may elect not to go bowling just to satisfy your partner and prevent a fight from occurring. The person being accused or questioned often triesto prove over and over again that they have done nothing wrong but it doesn\\'t matter. And that brings me to the point of what some peoplewho experience these behaviorsdo in order to start feeling like they have some power again.Here are just a few things:1. They realize there is no right answer. Trying to be logical with someone who doesn\\'t want to be logical doesn\\'t work. Many people simply stop trying to defend themselves against false accusations because there was no answer that would satisfy their partner anyway.In addition the rules of the relationship seem to change on a daily basis and what may be okay with your partner one day may make them angry the next. And this can leave people constantly feeling like they are on eggshells.2.The find support. Finding a support group or a group of people who remind you on a daily basis that you are a decent person is always a good idea. One of the things that can happen when we are with someone who does emotionally abusive thingsis begin to have a negativeconcept of ourselves. Surrounding yourself with people who remind you that you are a good personis a great idea. 3.They reinvest in themselves. Try to find some time for yourself. This couldn\\'t possibly sound more clich\\\\u00e9 but it is actually true. Whether that is taking up a new hobby or doing an old one. One thing that can happen when emotional abusetakes place in a relationshipis the personbeing abused can begin to isolate and not do the things that make them enjoy life. Taking some time for the self can sometimes bring things into perspective.I don\\'t know if you are still in counseling but if you are and you are getting what you need then that is great. If not there are others you can try. It\\'s important to find the right fit. As for the question of whether or not you should leave your partner that is a question that can only be answered by you. But you could ask yourself some questions like these to help you decide:1. What are some of my values about relationships? DoIwant Trust? Honesty? Ask yourself if you have these things in your relationship.2. Do I feel like this relationship brings out the best in me or does it seem to bring me down?3. If I want to stay in this relationship what are some specific things that need to change? Hope some of these suggestions help. Good luck to you.

As for taking your friend\\'s pills my concern would be the legal ramifications that you could face should you ever be caught with someone else\\'s prescription medication and especially these types of medications. Our laws have become much more strict surrounding prescription drug sales and possession due to the increase in prescription drug abuse. In addition people who are in active addiction are likely to find some other means to get their drug so it would do little to help the overall problem. I don\\'t know about your friend\\'s family situation but they may be a better route to take if you are concerned about your friend. They may already be involved but with your helpyoumaybe able to convince your friend to go to treatment willingly. That is usually better. In many states there are also involuntary committal processes where a person\\'s family may be able to convince a court to force the person into treatment. This varies from state to state.

There are few things that people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feel connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread.

It sounds like there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case then remaining safe is your top priority.  Assuming you are able to share with him your feelings telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate and sexually healthy.

Now if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you can explore to learn information. I will warn you some websites and articles are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed.  Many people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships but again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is also important to know that BDSM is notjust one thing and people practice it differently based on comfort.

The question about whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered by you. However here are a few things to consider and questions to ask yourself to help you find your answer: 1. Do you feel like you are violating your own values or morals? This is important because we all have different values and morals surrounding sex love and monogamy. If you value monogamous relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner then you may feel like you are living in contradiction to your values and most people are not happy when they do that. However if monogamy is not something you value then perhaps it is time to re-evaluate the relationship and determine if it is still right for you. Not all people want monogamous relationships and that is alright. Finallyif you value your husband\\\\u2019s feelings and know that the affairs would hurt him then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your own values. That can only be determined by you.  2.Based on how you describe your relationship it sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is. From the outside it looks like the affairs are a way to \\\\u201cget even\\\\u201d with your husband or to feel better after an argument. This is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a relationship and gets replaced with contempt. We can simply stop caring about how our actions hurt each other or potentially hurt each other. Perhaps the question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your husband is this the pattern that you want to keep? The pattern of very little sex argument and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs.  3.What are your goals for this relationship? If we start to become disconnected in a relationship we can begin to do things on autopilot. Get up get the kids up go to work come home and go to bed. None of which requires any intimacy at all. Are you still able to see the hopes and dreams you once had for this relationship? 4. Have you considered seeking marital counseling? Not having affairs won\\\\u2019t actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading you to have them. If there is something broken it sometimes requires some help to get it fixed.  Hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship. I certainly wish you well.  Robin J. Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   END\",\"578\":\"  Hello and thank you for your question. Loving someone who doesn\\\\u2019t respect or treat you well can be enormously difficult and painful.  Many people who find themselves in an emotionally hurtful relationship say that it was wonderful when it first started but that over time their partner\\\\u2019s behaviors changed and they became emotionally or physically abusive.  I want to say right away that it is not your fault in any way if someone is abusive to you. It does not mean that you are broken or that there is something wrong with your character if you have not left the situation. People stay for many reasons such as fear finances children pressure from others and love.  Many people have had to leave their abusive partners who they still love to preserve their own safety and regain the sense of self they may have lost. It is a very difficult thing to do even if you know it is the right thing.  The person who really needs to take a hard look at themselves is the person doing the abusing. It is very common for mental and emotional abuse to wear away at someone\\\\u2019s self-esteem. This can lead to other problems like depression and anxiety. These issues sometimes require professional support to manage such as a counselor or perhaps a doctor who may prescribe medication.  A counselor may be able to help you sort through your fears and concerns about staying or leaving. To look at things from different angles and to help you decide what is best for you.  You have not said that your husband has been physically abusive to you but if that has been the case then you must consider your physical safety first. Leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time. Getting help from professionals would be critical and I would recommend your local domestic violence program.  Whatever you decide to do is the right thing for you. I would encourage you to ask yourself honestly about your reasons for staying and the barriers that may keep you from going. You do deserve to be happy and emotionally safe. If you do not feel like you have that safety then seeking someone to help you sort through these things is a good plan.  I wish you well. Robin J.

END\",\"583\":\"  Hello and thank you for your question. Being bisexual can be particularly difficult because it is often misunderstood even by people who are \\\\u201csupposed\\\\u201d to be part of your own community such as lesbians and gays. It happens so often that there is actually a term for it \\\\u2013 bi-erasure. This is simply something that happens when people deny that bisexuality is a real thing or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs like your parents seem to have.  The unfortunate truth is that you can never be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information. It sounds promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations and it may simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality. With accurate information they may come around but there is no way to be sure.  Some of my colleagues have already given you good information. Here are some morethings that you can consider and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them:  1. If they don\\\\u2019t respond the way you want them to have you developed a support system to support you through it? This is very important. The truth is that all the friends in the world won\\\\u2019t prevent pain or sadness if your parents don\\\\u2019t respond as you hope but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE okay as you are. And that is critical for you to remember.   2. There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can offer your parents if you think it would be helpful. It may be important for them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality. Here is an article from GLAAD about bi-erasure: http:\\\\/\\\\/www.glaad.org\\\\/bisexual\\\\/bierasure  3. Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take place when you are ready. Sometimes people get pressured from friends media and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are ready. It really is up to you. If you are feeling pressure from others don\\\\u2019t feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out on your own time. Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand this.   4. Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual. Just because someone is LGBTQ doesn\\\\u2019t mean that they necessarily want to be. Many people struggle with this. Having your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are in telling your parents. So perhaps do some self-exploration about your feelings toward yourself.   Sometimes people take friends with them when they decide to come out to their parents. This is something you may want to consider. The important thing to remember is that you are okay. Really. If your parents don\\\\u2019t respond well that doesn\\\\u2019t mean that they never will. Some start off upset but then work their way through it.  Best of luck to you.  Robin J. Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   END\",\"584\":\" It sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you wish you were different or someone else and ultimately reject you. One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? Is there anything in people\\'s words or behaviors that gives you this impression? If your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer. END\",\"585\":\"  Hello and thank you for your question. You are clearly a resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help. Good for you. I have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts too.  First good for you for taking care of yourself and making really good decisions \\\\u2013 such as not getting into the car with dad when he is intoxicated. It is really important that you consider your safety above all else.  To answer your heading question yes it is quite common for people to blame themselves for other people\\\\u2019s actions. There are various reasons why we do this. For one thing someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault. And depending on things like our relationship to that person past experiences and our self-esteem we may actually start to believe it. What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility to be sure that you are safe and cared for not the other way around.  As for the other things you mentioned I am concerned about both your physical and emotional safety and well-being. It sounds like your father has an alcohol abuse problem and living with someone who is struggling with addiction can be hard for anyone let alone a teenager who is also trying to deal with things like school.  You may want to see if your school has a counselor or someone you can talk to about what is going on. I will tell you that in some states what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to report to child protection services but not necessarily. If you are concerned about that ask the counselor what they are obligated to report.  If you don\\\\u2019t know a counselor think about any other adult that you would feel comfortable talking to. They may have some ideas.  Sometimes individual states have non-profit chat lines or hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things. You may be able to find something like that in your state. I do warn your about doing random searches not every website is good so be careful.  This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in so one of the things that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on taking care of yourself. Sometimes things like this can really bring us down and we stop doing the things we enjoy. Try really hard not to let that happen. If you have interests do them. If you catch yourself thinking too hard about things try to find something fun to do to distract yourself. Try to take care of yourself in other ways such as eating well. Exercise can really help when we get stressed.  I hope some of this was helpful. Good luck.  Robin J. Landwehr DBH LPC NCC   END\",\"586\":\" Hello and thank you for your question. Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesn\\'t usually do much to help us in the long-run. People may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they don\\'t have something else to help them change permanently such as a new skill. So guilt doesn\\'t necessarily help us. In fact as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive. When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesn\\'t happen again.Thatyouhave done what you can to make amends if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well for one thing it doesn\\'tusuallyhelp the people who you hurt. In fact someone\\'s guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt over and over again about what happened. Guilt is usually 100% about us and not about those we hurt. Also guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some or consider getting help from a counselor. Be wellRobin Landwehr DBH LPC NCC END\",\"587\":\" Hello and thank you for your question. This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly but unfortunatelyI can\\'t do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly some drop hints some have had others tell their parents etc. The only right way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out and some wait for a very long time. Both ofthese things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal and there can be real consequences to someone\\'s emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support thatyou need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is there is a spectrum of how people\\'s parents react to this kind of news. On one end you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a Coming Out party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that theirfeelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to leave. You don\\'t have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you.

I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It is really hard to say since I don\\\\u2019t know you how old you are etc. But I will share you with you some thoughts.

What are my feelings about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution about what is going on.  One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them but another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe that it is second possibility. And that is okay.  You can try some of my suggestions but you can also see a counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues.

It appears you were close to her in many ways and she had a great influence in your life. The grief process of anger denial despair and acceptance may be a part of what is keeping you feeling stuck in a cycle of not feeling motivated to find work at this time. Perhaps your mind is constantly fighting this grief? Death can be a traumatic experience for some people and is considered a great loss thus the grief process may continue to be a part of your world for a time but hopefully not keep you stuck on a long-term basis. I would try to reach out to a counselor to discuss this grief process at a deeper level to discern whether her death is part of why you feel this way. Grief and loss can also have an effect on your self-esteem. Can you begin to see how this cycle is what you may be experiencing?One positive I see is that you are continuing to look for a new job! Take time to give yourself some credit for the time you are spending looking for work. Also I would recommend you set some short-term goals first for example make a list of 5-10 potential new employers and send them each your resume. Then followup the next week with an email or phone call to make sure the hiring manager or human resources received your resume and have any questions. It is also a good idea to ask for informational interviews in order to get your foot in the door so to speak.I hope that this information is helpful to you!

If the child is considered an adult by state law with regard to counseling (states differ on this - the range is typically between age 13 and age 18) no one is allowed to be in the session without the child\\'s consent.Second ethical and legal standards generally require that a counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but not both. This means that a counselor should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should have custody of a child.Third knowing the details of any parenting plan or separation agreement is important. Generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and can be present during the child\\\\u2019s sessions. If a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the child\\\\u2019s sessions.In a situation like this I would strongly recommend seeking out legal advice specific to your state law.

For example if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours he has an obligation to follow through on that promise.All that being said it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too. It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptly.In the end I agree with Sherry\\'s advice.

He or she will have done a lot personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist. This person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges not as a diagnostic category.

Further they will be well versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall. The in-depth work will be collaborativel designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you the moment your overall life experience and their in-the-moment experience.

As Carl Jung stated When the doctor sits down with the patient he (or she) must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person. The approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development attention to pre-verbal imprinting development of awareness ability ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience development of a process orientation attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest increased ability to access and contain non-ordinary states of consciousness attending to what is and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human development.depression is generally experienced as the system shutting down. anxiety is a signal that something is wrong. anxiety is not the problem. it is a sign that there is a problem. the core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding. the work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and re-initiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage.

Everyone fantasizes about something. In relationships it is absolutely normal to have fantasies of a sexual natureabout other people whether they are real or imaginary. This could certainly include fantasies about people of the same gender. Marriage doesn\\'t stop us from fantasizing but it may stop us from acting on our fantasies if we are in a monogamous relationship. It seems to me that you may be wondering if having these fantasies says something about someone\\'s sexual orientation. It may or may not. One thing that is important to think about is that there is a lot more variety in people\\'s sexual interests than what we generally learn about in society. We mostly talk about lesbian straight gaybisexual orqueer folks but there are actually many other interests than those. Some people are attracted to some men and women and yet they are married to one partner and remain committed and monogamous in that relationship. They may still fantasize however. Other people are simply curious and are aroused by the thought of someone of the same gender but they have no plan to explore the interest. There aremany possibilities and that could include the possibility of being gay or bisexual. So is it normal? Yes. Not every married man has these fantasies obviously but some surely do. Where there may be a problem is if the person is actually struggling with their sexual orientation and the fantasies are about more than just curiosity and arousal. If that is the case then the person may need help sorting through feelings that mayconfuse them. Hope this was helpful.Robin J.

Sleep problems including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about are really common for people and so many people suffer from them. Here are a few things to consider or to try: 1. Have you changedor started taking any new medication lately? Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams. If you are taking a new medication talk to your provider about the nightmares this may be the cause. 2. Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states. The dreams may not make much sense but then again even good dreams don\\'t always make much sense. Ask yourself do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life? Work school relationships health.... all of these areasand many more are places where stress can hide out. If this is the case talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help. 3. Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something we can begin to obsess about it. My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you. Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed. This could increase your chances of having another bad dream. Try relaxation techniques before going to bed. If you have YouTube you can pull up Guided Meditation for Sleep exercises to help you relax. There are many different ones to choose from. You may also want to try deep breathing.4. There are self-help ideas for managing bad nightmares.

Many people start to think that may be the case if they are still suffering from the affects of something that happened a long time ago. That\\'s not the case. There is no time set time for which we should be over something like this. I am not sure if you received counseling after what happened to you but that may be something to consider. Bad nightmares could be the sign of something like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) which would include other symptoms like being startled easily re-experiencing the event or avoiding places that remind you of it. There are other symptoms as well so if you believe this may be something you have you may want to seek counseling. There are good treatments for PTSD. If you cannot seek counselingat this time there are some things you can do to try to manage the dreams on your own. I would encourage you to look up sleepy hygiene and try to make your bedtime rituals as relaxing as possible. You can also Google search Nightmare re-scripting or Nightmare Exposure and get some ideas on how you may be able to change your dreams.

If they are affecting you the the point where you feel like you need to do something you may want to consider processing your memories of the events with a trained trauma therapist.

END\",\"648\":\" It can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships. Parents can usually tell when their child is happy. But kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner. Others may internalize symptoms appearing sad or withdrawn.A parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone. A parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play unsure of how to join the group.Therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends. Itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer groupAsk a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play. If a mom or dad can make the play dates happen or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own.I encourage well-meaning parents to choose words carefully. Use phrases like Hey I noticed something or Let me help you be successful. By showing respect parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zone.When to seek professional help.When does isolation raise a red flag for long-term issues? True personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood. Still professional counseling should be considered if the anti-social behavior is causing the child significant distress perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities. Also parents should pay attention to how the child\\'s social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety.The vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy healthy and normal. If the child is able to nurture at least one friendship exhibiting what experts call social reciprocity then parents can relax and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company.

I think it\\'s important to remember that there is no right or wrong way to deal with loss and the best way for you may not be the best way for someone else. The fact that you are aware that you are smoking more marijuana and drinking more and the fact that you can recognize that these may not be the best coping techniques is a very good step towards giving yourself some better support at this time. Marijuana and drinking are type of coping techniques that can numb us to our emotions but they do not really help us to work through those emotions.When it comes to grief often one of the most helpful ways to move through the phases of grief is to use your social supports talk to your friends and family see your mutual friends and commiserate with each other on the loss and the uncertainty. The more we talk about our feelings the more we are okay with them being ours. The more we express our loss the better we become at accepting such a loss. In talking with your supports you may also decide ways in which you may want to remember your friend ways you can do so on a personal level (writing a poem planting a tree etc.) or ways you as a group can remember and memorialize them (a special day where you get together to share your memories starting a charity etc.)We never truly get over our losses but we can learnt o accept the losses and what it means to us now...but that also takes time.

I can understand how difficult this time maybe for you especially if you have several unanswered the questions due to the circumstances surrounding the death of your friend. It\\'s during this time that you may experience the various stages of grief. This includes denial anger bargaining depression and finally acceptance.In the bereavement process there is so specific time frame or lengths of time for someone to work through each step. Its imperative to note that one mayexpress each stage with different levels of intensity. Also the five stages do not necessarily occur in any specific order. We often move between stages before achieving a more peaceful acceptance of death. Just note that everyone greives differently some internalize their feelings and emotions others express it externally while other avoid it all together.Coping with loss is ultimately a deeply personal and singular experience. Sometimes we feel that no one understands what we are feeling or going through much less comprehend our emotional state of mind . What\\'s important is that you allow others to comfort you through the various stages. My recommendation is to allow yourself to go through the emotions and feel the grief. Avoiding or resisting may only delay the healing process. Reaching the acceptance stage of mourning is a gift not not everyone is awarded but seeking the help of a Grief counselor may assist in deciphering your emotions and set you on a more positive path to achieve closer.

His name is Sam Dylan Finch and he is transgender. He writes about mental health transgender issues and many other topics. I know he has frequently written about gender dysphoria and ways to manage it. You may want to check out his site and do a search on there. 2. The website www.everydayfeminism.com employs many transgender writers and several have written about gender dysphoria and have given ideas for managing it. If you search for gender dysphoria on their site many articles pop up. It may be a good resource for you especially if you ever feel lonely and start to forget that there are others out there who are like you and have your back. 3. I am not sure where you live but there are counselors who specialize in affirmative therapy which is what is recommended for folks who are part of the LGBTQ community. So if you decide to see a counselor about the dysphoria try to find one that specifically says they have been trained in the affirmative approach. In addition feel free to ask questions of the counselor before agreeing to see them for counseling. An ethical counselor would have no problem answering them before having you come in. 4. If there are some LGBTQ resource centers in your area try to reach out to them and see if there are support groups. Gaining more support from others would be helpful. Sometimes LGBTQ-friendly counselors leave their contact information for people in resource centers. 5. Finally I know you have not mentioned being depressed or suicidal but I also know that it is very common for people to considersuicide when they are struggling with dysphoria dealing with transphobia etc. If this ever happens to you please call 911 or the Trans Lifeline.

It\\'s not the only type of therapy that can help but it seems to help people in a way that is more natural and realistic. As Cory mentioned anxiety is something that is part of life so therapies that indicate we can get rid of it are questionable. Our natural inclination when we have anxiety is to STOP any and all things that may cause it or provoke it. We do this because we think it will help but it actually doesn\\'t. Anxiety usually has us rehashing the past or rehearsing the futurewhile ignoring the present. ACT helps folks who have those kinds of tendencies. Be well..Robin J.

Hope this helpsC END\",\"677\":\" It has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal. Often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue. For some depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated they discover that they are anxious (worried) about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts (either in their mind or in practical application) to resolve the anxiety depression is often the result. In this type of case depression is not the main or underlying issue. The anxiety is the underlying issue. Having a lot on my mind sounds like anxiety. Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with emptiness. In the question above I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having a lot on my mind and determine where these might be coming from. Has there been ongoing rejection from peers? From family? If so why does this seem to be happening? Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. Where does that need to protect originate? Are there unmet needs from childhood? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to self-protect as a defense mechanism?We can feel alone even when in a crow of people or at a party. This has nothing in this case to do with being around people. It has more to do with how we view ourselves. If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says You are worth nothing or You don\\'t deserve the company of others then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time.The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people then EMDR can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma. Looking at whether this individual\\'s issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy.

If you haven\\'t seen a primary care provider in a while you may want to. There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels even at your age. It doesn\\'t hurt to get checked out. If they find the cause they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms. In addition most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild moderate and sometimes severe depression. So don\\'t be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an anti-depressant if they diagnose you with depression. Medication is not the only way to treat depression but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2. You may want to consider counseling since it is another effective way to treat depression. A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place. This could include thoughts behaviors beliefs life experiences and other things. 3. Finally to answer your question about whether these feelings are normal. These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition. It is important to remember that even if these symptoms are abnormal it doesn\\'t mean that YOU are. Millions of people struggle with depression. So remember the symptoms are the problem not YOU. Hope this helps. Be well.Robin J.

One is that people who are asexual have absolutely no interest in sex and that is not always the case. There are variations of asexuality.

Sometimes it\\'s tough even when we are 100% sure that it is the right thing to do!I am going to give you some of my thoughts and hopefully some colleagues will add some others. One of the things that I want to point out is that letting go is not really a thing. In other words it\\'s not really something you can reach out and grab. It\\'s more of a process. This is good news because you don\\'t necessarily have to be atthe end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship. We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over. For example someone can end an unhealthy relationship today but then be reminded of the good times on what wouldhave been their anniversary. This could make the person very sad. They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while. It would important then for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end and that they are healthier because of it. This is relevant for you. It\\'s hard to walk away from a relationship. We fear all kinds of things including being single! Sometimes it\\'s helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship. It\\'s helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship. It\\'s fine to admit uncertainly about ending things. It\\'s okay to be afraid. It\\'s okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt. And even with all of thatsomeonecan still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them. They can have sadness later on and still not go back.It sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce. The truth is that there is not necessarily a perfect time to end any relationship. There would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce.

Landwehr DBH LPC NCC END\",\"683\":\" Hello and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that this was your experience with your family. I truly wish Icould give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately I can\\'t do that. Their acceptance of youis a journey just like coming out is a journey for you. Sometimes families initially respond this way but after time they become more accepting and even supportive. Unfortunately there is no way to know for sure if that will happen. So here are a few things I would suggest:Surround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are. That won\\'t take the place of your family\\'s acceptance and I won\\'t even pretend that it would but it may help during those days when it hurts the most. And that is really important. Patience is not something that many of us are really good at but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some. When families first learn something like this they may go through a period of shock. And then sometimes even grieving. They may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden. These things can take time for them to reconcile so it may just take some patience. If it is safe for you try to talk to them but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away. I do recommend setting upsome personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them. The reason I feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like you\\'re describing. They may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around. They may or they may not. And if they don\\'t you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are. To be surrounded by folks who remind you of that.If you startseeing this pattern and you are struggling chatting withcounselor may be a great idea. I am bias probably but I think chatting with a counselor is ALWAYS a good idea. :)Hope this helps. Be well. Be you. Robin J.

Children no longer need the basics (food shelter. water safety) as much as when they were toddlers but rather their needs shift to wanting more support encouragement advice and room to make mistakes.

For some of the couples I work with in my practice I find that helping to organize a time apart which I call a Therapeutic Separation can do wonders for the relationship. I offer homework to be done during this time. Reading worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship.

Start by sitting down with a journal and summarizing the time line of the relationship. Include both the good and bad the ups and downs. When you get to the finale of your story you create the ending. Do not frame yourself as the victim. Think about what was most likely going on in his head. Usually there are clues that we might not see clearly until after the fact. Writeabout what you learned from the relationship and thepositive growth you experienced.

While the stress may have physical symptoms addressing the root cause of the problem has nothing to do directly with something being physically wrong with your daughter.Unless there is some other medical or physical problem that would explain your daughter\\'s sense of stress I\\'d start first by bringing your areas of concern to your daughter then possibly to a therapist.

Sometimes physical dysphoria means less time around mirrors or plans to make showering less stressful (music audio books distraction). Sometimes online support networks can be a great source of ideas in this way (for social and mental dysphoria as well). Some of my clients do things that help them feel better in their bodies that don\\'t require anyone to know (hair removal binders packing hormones) and other things. I recommend stopping by a website called Conversations with a Gender Therapist. There are some awesome videos there that might help you! I hope this helps some!

Also allow him to clean up himself. Gather cleaning supplies and and oversee cleaning operations without ridicule or negative feedback. Since you have stated that you have an adolescent who is experiencing enuresis you may want to check with your PCP and a licensed professional for underlying diagnosis that can be treated.

I don\\'t know your age or gender so please excuse any incorrect assumptions about you being under 18 and use what is useful from the ideas if you are older. One idea is to research online to find a therapist or a local clinic that has a therapist who is a Gender Therapist or a Gender Specialist. Most therapists who are transgender affirmative also have other specialties and do general therapy. Though I don\\'t think lying to your parents is a good idea if you feel you truly can\\'t talk to them about your gender then perhaps you can find a therapist with a specialization in gender identity who can help you cope with your gender dysphoria. You can let your parents know that you would like to see that particular therapist for other reasons such as anxiety\\\\/worry and that you researched them and liked their website. Work to find a therapist who takes your parents insurance if you can. You can also talk to the therapist on the phone first before you talk to your parents about scheduling the first therapy visit. Therapists can help you learn some ways to manage feelings of worry shame and fear related to gender dysphoria. Depending on your family situation many therapists will work to help you learn skills to safely communicate with your parents about what is troubling you. Your parents may actually surprise you and be more accepting than you think. Usually when parents learn that you are suffering they want to be open to learning how they can help you even if awkwardly at first.Reframing is a tool that helps you think about your situation from other perspectives. It\\'s kind of how you can look at the same picture with a different picture frame and it makes the same picture look a little different.  Keep in mind your situation is probably temporary and think about in the context of your whole long life (can you tolerate another 2 to 4 years living like you are if you have another X number of years to live?). If you are living at home you will eventually be more independent and be able to make more of your decisions about your gender expression. Keep the idea in mind the concept that is popular in mindfulness classes I teach that This too shall pass or This is only for now when you start to feel hopeless. If you start to over focus on your gender or body issues try to distract yourself with things that make you feel happy (your pet music art sports etc) or stay busy. If you can find any GSA or LGBTIQQ youth group that you can attend confidentially further away from home to get some support. Work to find an ally one person that you can talk to about what you are feeling. Making new friends online through social media can sometimes be a start in breaking down the isolation you feel. Another idea if you are under 24 years old there is a phone line (866-488-7386) to call in case you are ever feeling you are in crisis. You can also text chat!

Can you do small things that help you get more in touch with your gender day to day like making small choices about your clothing like wearing clothes that are more unisex that only you know are gender related but others won\\'t notice? You cannot force others to accept you but you can work on your self-acceptance and self-compassion.

Often times when we have difficulty trusting others it is because we have specific fears about what would happen if we get close or let our guard down.

For example tell yourself something positive before talking to your parents such as I feel confident in myself and I am doing this to overcome my fear of talking to my parents can help to decrease the anxiety you are feeling leading up to the conversation.I would recommend if you are feeling depressed or down it would be beneficial to seek counseling to understand your current thoughts and behaviors.

What I can do is tell you some of the things that transgender people have told me and information that I have read. Perhaps a transgender therapist will also have the opportunity to answer your question. From the experiences that I have read and heard the realization process went from either knowing right away to looking more like a journey. I have personal friends who are currently working through how to identify their gender and they are well into adulthood. One person explained thatthe term\\'transgender\\' didn\\'t feel right for them in terms of how they felt and believed that perhaps they are genderfluid. This means that there is no rush to figure it out and many different ways to identify. There are therapists trained in the Affirmative Therapy model who may begood supportive helpers that can assist you as you continue to look for answers.

To be honest this kind of behavior is really emotionally abusive and you likely know that already. The unfortunate truth is there is very little we canactuallydo to change another adult\\'s behavior if they are not interested in changing it. Many people who behave in this way actually feel justified in saying what they say or even believe that they are helping in some way by telling you how to improve yourself. What is actually going on is an attempt to control or change something about you by being coercive and abusive. It is important to know that this kind of behavior doesn\\'t necessarily show up right away. That is why I am not surprised that you are a year in to this relationship and are just now noticing these behaviors. Some people actually don\\'t see them until they are already married! You didn\\'t mention that there has been any physical abuse but I would warn you that this is sometimes a possibility once a person has already begun to be emotionally abusive. Other things to watch out for is your boyfriend trying to control who you hang out with what you do and how you dress etc. These are just more examples of emotional abuse and control. Here are some things to consider and some ideas:1. You could talk to your boyfriend about this behavior if you believe it is safe to do so. Perhaps he will recognize that his behavior is not okay and change. If not then you may need to decide what you want to do about this relationship given the fact that you cannot force him to change. 2. You can call a local domestic violence program. They do not only work with people who have been physically abusedor have been married. They are trained to talk about emotional abuse also. It may be a good thing for support. Your calls are confidential. 3. Check out the wheel in the link below. On it you will find some other common ways that abuse can happen in a relationship. If any of these are happening to you or begin to happen talking to a domestic violence program a trusted friend or family member ora counselor would be a good idea.http:\\\\/\\\\/www.domesticviolence-wilm.org\\\\/Portals\\\\/97\\\\/Images\\\\/violence_wheel.gif Be well....

I say lonely because when things like this happen we often don\\'t know what to say to each other and so we suffer in silence with little support.Here are a few thoughts that I am having and perhaps others will add things too:1. By the sound of your main question it seems like you have every intention to be there for your boyfriend during this difficult time. I am not sure if he is willing to talk about his health situation but letting him know that you want to support him and also need his support may be helpful. 2. If it is possible see if he would be willing to go to a counselor with you. There are many things that a counselor could focus on that may help your relationship but also help you both cope with what is happening.3.

A third person distracts from the content and reasons for disagreeing.Maybe knowing that by pulling yourself away from mediating family arguments you will in the long term be doing good for your family helps you do the actual work of separating yourself from their arguments.Definitely the fact that you\\'re writing about the problem shows you feel like doing something which feels better than how you feel currently.It is very healthy for you to listen to your gut intuition telling you to pull out of the mediator role you are in currently.You may feel guilty your family members will most likely do everything possible to persuade convince and push you back into their arguments.This doesn\\'t make them right in what they\\'re doing it only makes your job harder of trying to let them have their fights on their own.

Sometimes more physical activities such as doing a few jumping jacks can be helpful. If you don\\'t exercise it might be something to talk with your doctor about first.The more you can learn about what makes you want to cut the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that.

If you are both open to the possibility of someone else helping out this may help with some of the difficulties between you if you are not spending quite as much time together.

If you are under 18 you may be able to have Medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment. If you are over 18 there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation you\\'re in. Maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agencies.If you are in school you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school.

What attributes do you have to give back to that relationship? END\",\"780\":\" It sounds like you have several different things happening at the same time.

Who is it that you trust or could speak with about this? A therapist could be one person but perhaps there is someone else in your life as well.One thing that may help is to find a bead or rock that is smooth and you can hold onto it while thinking of a specific memory where you were happy. This could be from as long ago as necessary as long as it is specific and you can place yourself back in that time when you are thinking about it. If you think about this time while holding onto the bead the bead may remind you of a time when you felt happy.

I don\\'t know what else your life involves whether you have close friends or a romantic partner a career activities that you like to do and many other things.

If you are saying that you are not attracted to your girlfriend you could try changing what you do during sexual intimacy. You could also try slowly using nonsexual touch and discussing what you each like and would prefer to do more of compared to what is not as desirable. After doing this for nonsexual touching it can also be used with sexual touching. Looking at more of what you like or would like to feel may be of help.

END\",\"788\":\" It\\'s hard to tell from the way you described it. Do you think he would be open to an honest discussion? It could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter. As far as scanning you from head to toe I can think of reasons that parents might do that. I also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are. That way it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are. END\",\"789\":\" There are many possible answers here. It could be that she misses friends that she felt safe in the other house (emotionally safe and comfortable) or dozens of other things. Will she talk about it when she\\'s not mad? You mentioned that she has an attachment issue. It could also be that she was attached to the house. It\\'s not the same as being attached to a person but possessions and safe places certainly mean a lot. END\",\"790\":\" A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt since you did not hurt him.

Think of a time when you felt safe comfortable happy \\\\u2013 basically a positive and safe moment \\\\u2013 while holding onto the rock.

I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted? If you can sort out some possible answers to that maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happen.Also again depending on the age of your children some parents can do things while the children are sleeping even if you are in the same room. For example if your children are sleeping for about two hours maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do. END\",\"795\":\" Talking about it would probably be helpful if you\\'re both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important. It may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time. You can adjust the timing for what works for both of you. After one of you is talking perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say. This can lessen confusion.I know you say that she avoids it. It might be a good place to start talking about it \\\\u2013 to see what makes her avoid it. It could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she can\\'t talk to them.

If you are not sleeping while you are in bed consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed. Hopefully you\\'ll be able to establish a pattern.Sometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well.

So for example if you are genetically and biologically female but you feel as though you are a male that would be the initial concept of considering whether or not you are transgender. Just in the effort to be clear the same idea applies if you are genetically and biologically male and feel as though you\\'re female.This goes beyond people who enjoy dressing in the clothes of the opposite gender although people who are transgender will sometimes do this as well.

I don\\'t know how well the two of you have communicated over the last year but if you are concerned about this turning into an argument you may consider asking him to just listen to your point of view and see if he is able to summarize it correctly.

It sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each other\\'s mind without being able to communicate effectively.

That doesn\\'t necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him since traditional medical treatment is not something he wants.You may also consider using some open-ended questions (not yes or no answers) to talk about what you\\'re feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship. Both of you may discuss different ways that you would like support from one another.I would also see if he was comfortable with you disclosing this to one or a few of your close friends (with him considering doing the same) so that you both have support that includes each other and also includes others because there may be days when you both have a negatively emotional day at the same time and would benefit from talking with someone else.It may also be a matter of conversation to discuss what makes you happy together and use those positive moments to help move through more difficult ones.

You said that at times you feel like everyone is lying. Ask yourself some of these questions. What is it that makes you feel so strongly that they are lying? Where is the concrete evidence that they are lying? How could I test my thoughts about this? What if things are not what they seem on the surface? Am I any lesser of a person as a result of this person\\'s behavior or opinion? Our beliefs about ourselves and the people and our world and how we interpret information and experiences have a significant effect on how we feel and how we behave. It is important to objectively challenge the beliefs that contribute to negative emotions. You can start this process by answering some of the above questions. We are unfortunately influenced by what and who we associate with. As it pertains to if God is a lie be honest with yourself and question your beliefs that tell you that God is or is not real. It may be helpful for you to speak to a preacher or chaplain of some sort and they can help you with a lot of that. Hope this helps at least a little bit.  END\",\"820\":\" Thank you for posting. I\\'m interested to hear some more information such as if you live by yourself or family if you go to school\\\\/employed\\\\/unemployed and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself. Often times when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not alwaysfeel that specific emotion. There are typically points in the day (even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals) when we do not feel that negative emotion. When we overgeneralize we use words like always or never and when we use those words and it may not be totally true we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you. Ask yourself some of these questions: Am I being realistic when I\\'m overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasn\\'t feeling anxious? What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about? When was the last time I felt empathy? What was different when I was able to feel empathy? Hopefully this helps get you started.

My question for you is what does real actually mean to you? Often the concept of God has to do with what you believe in.

I would suggest though that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do. You may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure. The local Salvation Army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services. There may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussion.Just a word of caution. In my experience ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe. Some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others. When initiating conversations about this try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality. A second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinions.As far as whether God is real or not consider trusting yourself and what you learn feel and believe as you work through this process.

You may want to spend a few minutes calling to mind any conversations that you have had with your father about transgender issues or if you have ever heard him talk about it. That may give you a small clue about how well he may accept this news from you. For example if he has been watching the news lately transgender rights is something that is being talked about a lot. Has he had an opinion? This won\\'t tell you for sure if he would be okay with learning you are transgender but at least you would know if there is hostility toward transgender people. To tell you the truth the best way to tell your dad is whatever way feels right to you. There is no right or wrong way best or worst. If you want to tell him when you are by yourself with him? That\\'s perfect. Want to have a friend with you for support? Equally perfect. Whatever thing you need to do. And of course there is always the option of not telling him anything until you are comfortable doing so. Unfortunately the response from your dad can\\'t be predicted. Some parents are totally cool.... others not so much. This is one reason why having someone with your for support is sometimes a good idea. If things get heated you have someone in your corner. There are therapists who specialize in affirmative therapy and they may be very helpful to you in working out how you want to tell him. You can also Google some stories about how others came out.I refer many people to the www.letsqueerthingsup.com blog. It is a popular blog written by a trans man that I know.

There are many different things than you could say and they are all related to how much you already to share with other people about how you feel regarding your gender.Generally I would suggest it would be important to become comfortable with how you feel yourself and possibly tell some people whom you really trust first. Also consider that once you tell someone something it\\'s not possible to undo it so if you tell someone they may tell someone else. Then there is also the matter of people having very different reactions related to different genders and not everyone will be supportive.

The decision could be whether or not stay together or it could be any number of other things such as what state to live in.When you ask whether you have to respect whatever decision he makes respecting his decision does not mean that you have to agree with what he decides. While you do not have the power to change his decision he also does not have the power to change yours or how you feel about it.

Is this medical advice or is this someone\\\\u2019s opinion trying to scare you from having sex? And if so how old are you? Is it ok to have sex do you want to have sex? It sounds like you want to make your partner happy and that you are taking care of protecting yourself and your partner but maybe you are forgetting to consider what do you really want. Having sexual relations is a very personal decision you and your partner have to consent. It is also important to talk about the possible consequences and being responsible for them as well. But sex should be something that you enjoy not that you should be fearful of. A therapist can help you to process those negative thoughts and feelings that may impair you from enjoying your sexual life.\\\\u00bfC\\\\u00f3mo puedo superar mi miedo de un embarazo no deseado y poder tener sexo otra vez?Estoy aterrorizado de tener sexo porque me han dicho una y otra vez que el sexo es peligroso inclusive cuando yo y mi pareja usamos dos m\\\\u00e9todos de protecci\\\\u00f3n.

END\",\"845\":\" The fact that you mention that he is constantly changing his mind on if he wants to work it out suggests that Discernment Counseling might be a really good fit for you both. Discernment counseling is a protocol for partners where one or both aren\\'t certain they want to remain in the relationship. It\\'s a brief (1-5 sessions) and intentionally focused on helping partners talk through (primarily individually) their reasons for and against staying in the relationship - as well as confront their own contributions that lead to the relationship crisis. It\\'s aimed at helping the couple reach a clear understanding of which path they are going to take not asking anyone to change just yet so it can be a lot less intimidating and more to the point than couples therapy. You can look to find a local therapist providing this service here.That said I agree with other respondents that if he is deciding to leave seeking out support for yourself would be incredibly helpful.You may need to accept his decision but you can certainly feel whatever emotions you have.You are allowed to feel exactly how you feel and it\\'s likely you\\'ll be sad or angry or hurt or disappointed or scared or any combination of any\\\\/all of those.Having someone there who can validate those emotions and help you to process the grief that naturally comes with the end of a relationship can be a huge help in finding a place of healing and regaining a sense of self a sense of hope. END\",\"846\":\" There\\'s a quote I love that says Wherever you go there you are and the book by the same name by Jon Kabat-Zinn may be very helpful for you. The thing about changing things up when they get tough is that they often aren\\'t the things that need changing. The awesome (and challenging) thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be. Through this deeper work you can actually be in the midst of chaos and still feel that calm and peace within yourself. If you look for support in this journey from a counselor or therapist I\\'d recommend looking for someone offering Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MCBT). Also helpful may be the online program of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MSBR) found here.There are in-person programs across the country but this online self-guided version is free and a great resource!

It may be helpful to talk to someone who you trust to get a sense of whether the changes that you are making are those that are considered adaptable or important changes that allow us all to grow. Another possibility is that you are changing things in an effort to get away from something that is uncomfortable or difficult. There are many other possibilities along this continuum.I would ask you to consider the following:What is leading you to want to change your job?What feelings are associated with this change? (Happy sad scared anxious\\\\/nervous confused motivated etc.)How is the job that you are looking to transfer to going to be better or different? Are the concerns that you have now going to travel with you?If you are hesitating to get another perspective (from trusted friends or family or some sort of career advisor in your area) where is the hesitation coming from?

If the voices are just at night is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dream?If you recall your nightmares consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patterns.One thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room you\\'re in. For example take time to notice your feet on the floor hips in the chair and shoulders against the back of the chair. You can also try mindfulness techniques such as noticing what is around you or changing your breathing patterns. These ideas may help in the meantime prior to having more specific ideas from someone near you.Thanks for reaching out!

END\",\"850\":\" It may be helpful to have this emotionally impactful conversation in the context of couples therapy.Whether or not you should get a divorce is not the first question that comes to mind for me but more along the lines of do you want to be together and what kind of relationship do you want to create?For some people polyamorous relationships (those involving more than two people) are acceptable. This does not work for everyone but if each of you agree that that is okay it may work for you and your husband. If it is something that you are both open to it is often beneficial to have more than one discussion about the details of what is acceptable for each of you.If you want to be devoted only to each other what does that lifestyle look like for each of you? What can you start or stop doing right now to move your relationship in that direction?Neither of you can make the other partner change. That does not mean you cannot talk about what each of your goals are together and support each other in working toward those goals you have for yourselves.Sometime having discussions like these is easier when there is a structure and\\\\/or someone in the room (like a therapist) who can help keep the conversation on topic and work on having each of you communicate in a way that expresses your wants wishes and desires in a way that is not blaming of your partner.If either of you wants a divorce that could be part of the discussion. Divorce is not the only choice here depending upon what each of you wants and is willing to accept learn and grow from as it relates to yourself and your partner. END\",\"851\":\" One thing that comes to mind is making a list of some things that happen each day. It could be that there are things that are affecting how upset you are but because so many other things are going on you may not notice.Another idea to try is to keep a list for a month of one good thing that happened each day. This way when you\\'re having a rough day you have a list to think of and take a look at.Are you eating and sleeping in ways that are typical for you (typically at least two meals per day and roughly 8 hours of sleep that night (may be different depending on your age)? These two ideas are closely related to changes in your mood.From where do you have support? Friends or family?Can you take 5 or 10 minutes per day to do something that you enjoy?If you think back to the last time that you felt content what was contributing to that?Another possibility is to try to be mindful of things that you do every day. For example rather than eating a turkey sandwich as fast as possible on your lunch break consider actually tasting it and enjoying it. Also consider giving yourself praise for doing something well. For example when you finish your paperwork take a moment to notice that and maybe reward yourself by checking your e-mail reading five pages of a book or something else that can be done quickly before you get back to your next task. END\",\"852\":\" Something to remember about anxiety is that it\\'s a useful and necessary response to stressors and we all have a level of anxiety that falls somewhere on the spectrum from very slight to very overwhelming. Anxiety is our brain\\'s way of prompting us to deal with the stress in our lives by getting us geared up for action.Some helpful ways of managing anxiety are actually very simple. The first I\\'d recommend is a calm breathing technique - breathe in for 4-5 seconds and then out for 7-8 seconds. Try to repeat this for 3-5 minutes. Another suggestion is to pay closer attention in the moments you feel the physical symptoms of anxiety and see if you can describe - without judging - the sensations to yourself. Try to be very specific such as my palms are feeling very sweaty and I can feel the slight tightness and fluttering in my belly of the butterflies. Then try to sit with these sensations without deciding if they are good or bad - just experiencing them as intentionally as possible. Combining the calm breathing with this technique can also be very helpful.If you feel that these techniques don\\'t help and your anxiety about everyday stressors are inhibiting you from being able to engage in life the way you want to then I\\'d highly recommend going for an assessment or even just consultation with a professional. This professional can help you determine if therapy\\\\/counseling would be helpful for you to develop additional skills for managing those interfering anxiety symptoms.

However many clients who struggle with self-harm can find help in outpatient settings - particularly those which offer a treatment called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). Looking for a DBT professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful but askilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions.Without knowing your location I also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline. The volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area. Calling into the helpline may also be a first step alternative to self-harming when you\\'re feeling overwhelmed.

As a married stepmother I\\'ve been there and as a therapist I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren\\'t alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step\\\\/blended family dynamics - because even if you\\'re not officially married those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved.

END\",\"860\":\" Hello and thank you for your question. When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be. Indeed it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we don\\'t feel very content with our lives. Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions: What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart? Whatkind of characterdo I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching? How would I want others to describe me? Let\\'s say that you want others to see you as being authentic and YOU also valueauthenticityas something you want to live by. You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now. That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart. This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation. So please try not to feel alone. We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay lesbian bisexual etc. And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves. Thinking about your valuesand living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom but I won\\'t lie it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time. For example someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for even if that means people may disapprove. That may cause a lot of pain but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity. It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them. I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are... both as an individual and as someone\\'s fianc\\\\u00e9.Above all I wish you well in this journey.

END\",\"862\":\" I first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to. I don\\'t know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirable.There is also a difference between having self-doubt about the actual physicality of having sex (performance-related) or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular person.Having sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability. If your partner is someone you trust consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex. This is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactions.Another idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other (perhaps first you to him and then him to you) and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like. Some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not. All of this can be part of your discussions. When you feel comfortable with that you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like. You may also consider discussing things that are totally off-limits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen. There are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itself.If this feels pretty structured it is initially. Generally the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more natural.If the concern relates more to self-esteem related sex consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you. Even if you don\\'t necessarily see yourself in the same light consider that this is how your partner sees you so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them (perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationship).If this is difficult for you to sort out on your own consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships.

That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine. Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection but it is there. So for example if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex a partner may take it as apersonal rejection rather thanresponse to stress trauma or grief. If your husband will agree to it couple\\'s counseling may be your best bet. A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy. If he doesn\\'t agree to go it may be worth it to go on your own. You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself. And sometimes our personally therapy can influenceothers so itmay be a good idea.

While counselors work closely with medical providers and sometimes have discussions about medications with people we rarely make recommendations about how much or what typeof medicationa person should be taking.

The only exception would be if a counselor is also a physician nurse practitioner physician\\'s assistant etc. Having said that I certainly understand that anxiety is a real serious problem that many folks struggle with. If you are currently not in therapy to help you with these panic attacks you should consider it. Medications can be helpful for anxiety and medications like Xanax may help for immediate relief but they do nothing to deal with the root of anxiety and may not help with anxiety long-term. Therapists who have experience in exposure therapies would be good people to start with. Exposure therapy hasgood outcomes for people with anxiety disorders and panic attacks. If you are interested in speaking with your provider about the Xanax I think explaining it the way you did on here is just fine. The provider will then decide if they feel comfortable increasing your medication. Please remember that medical providers are not trying to give people a hard time. Medications like Xanax really are highly addictive. The more you take the more you may feel you need. The more often you may feel you need to use it. Depending on the frequency and amount of use some people suffer serious withdrawal symptoms when they do not take the medication.

Finding out the cause of depression\\\\/anxiety isn\\'t always as straightforward as it seems since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific trigger\\\\/reason. For example if I am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life then I start seeing life through this lens of feeling down and typically I\\'ll start to see a lot more that I get down about and it can really build very quickly on itself.

Even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations you\\'re feeling - such as saying to yourself Okay I\\'m breathing really rapidly and my heart is racing now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight... Reminding yourself that it\\'s just your body\\'s reaction to stress and while it might be overreacting right now you\\'re okay and eventually it will go away.

Maybe there are certain parts that are more or less related to anxiety for you. Perhaps you have less anxiety while working or involved in a specific activity for example spending time with friends.When you are both in the same area (when your boyfriend is not traveling) do you do some things independently with friends?Do you know what leads to your anxiety when he is away? I don\\'t know whether it is a general feeling of wanting him to come back or anxiety that something specific will happen to you or him.Do you ever recall feeling this way in your past? If so what was happening then?What do you have that makes you feel very safe and comfortable?Consider working with a mental health professional in the area. Perhaps it would be helpful for the two of you to meet with a therapist who specializes in couples to see what kind of relationship you want to have and what you can each do to contribute to that relationship. There could be things that you could both start or stop doing to help your relationship move in the direction where you would like it to go. As an example perhaps you would like a text before your boyfriend goes to bed no matter what time zone or time of day it is. Perhaps he would prefer a good morning text or call\\\\/voicemail from you. END\",\"871\":\" First be aware that each end every one of us has anxiety at some point. That certainly seems to fit what you\\'re describing here but that doesn\\'t mean you have an anxiety disorder necessarily. That\\'s where there is a difference. Anyone who has a hard time with public speaking or feels uncomfortable in large crowds for example is experiencing anxiety.It sounds like it would be helpful to look at the differences between the days when you are more comfortable on the days that you are not. If you notice your anxiety is keeping you from doing things that you need or want to do it may be helpful to talk with and mental health professional.I wonder also whether your appetite and sleeping patterns are the same or similar to how they were before you experienced this anxiety when your anxiety started and whether you feel more comfortable when someone you trust is there with you.If you have an idea of times or situations in which you feel anxious consider carrying a small smooth rock or another object that makes you feel calm and centered. Perhaps you can keep it in your pocket and remember specific comfortable times while you have it in your hand. END\",\"872\":\" In general Xanax is very short-acting.You mentioned that you are afraid that your medical provider will take you off of the Xanax and put you on something else. If the Xanax is not working well for you I wonder if something else may work better. What is your reasoning there? Also sometimes there are medications that you can take in addition to Xanax.In addition to talking with your medical provider about changing the medication try to track your levels of anxiety on a scale of 1 to 10 throughout the day so you can get a pattern of what is happening. Also consider writing down what is happening before you have anxiety attacks. This may help your medical provider know what medication may be helpful to you or what changes could be made.As far as how to discuss this with your medical provider I would suggest mentioning the symptom changes you are having (anxiety attacks that are not helped with 0.5mg of Xanax) and ask what they would suggest that might help. If your medical provider suggests taking you off of the Xanax I would recommend talking about the reasons why you would prefer to stay on the Xanax and what your concerns are about coming off of it. You could also ask whether anything could be combined with Xanax.There are also many other anxiety medications. I have seen lots of people that take more than one medication to lessen anxiety that they are having.I would also consider talking with a therapist (unless the person who is prescribing a medication is also doing therapy with you).

I don\\'t know whether your use of the phrase messing around was related specifically to being romantically or sexually involved with the people who you are or referring to or if you are saying that you are enjoying spending time with them. These terms have different definitions for almost everyone.I would definitely recommend speaking with a local mental health practitioner in your area not because there is anything wrong about the way you are feeling but because there are a lot of different parts of what is happening in your life right now and it may be helpful to talk about the feelings and thoughts with someone who can help you to learn more about yourself and the people are most important in your life (yourself included).I also suggest looking at a few things that you love and appreciate about yourself. END\",\"874\":\" It sounds like you may be asking two different questions.With regard to what you said about your husband dressing as a female in your bedroom I wonder if you would consider asking him more about this. If you choose to do that I would suggest that you ask him whether a certain time is a good time to have a conversation and asking questions for five minutes or more that are related to you learning more about his experience. This can be difficult to do at times particularly when you may want to offer your own opinions or become very anxious or of type. Consider thinking of a phrase that may help you to stay calm during the discussion. It may be helpful to think of yourself as asking questions as if you were an investigative reporter and using questions that start with words like what how who where when. Questions that start with why can be very difficult to answer for some people and can be overwhelming because it often links to answers involving emotions that may or may not be understood.Also try restating what your husband is saying to make sure that you are understanding correctly. If what he is telling you is different than what you have heard or thought of for many years it may be challenging to follow his meaning initially. Remember that listening to your husband does not imply agreement with what he is saying just that you are following and looking to understand what he is experiencing. I also recommend sticking to one topic for the conversation but this could be done with many different topics over time.You could also see if he would be willing to have a discussion where he listens like an investigative reporter to learn more about the experience that you are having.As far as what you mentioned about the sexual experience maybe if you can discuss what it is that you don\\'t like and\\\\/or understand what it is that he does like you could see if there is some middle ground here. It depends on what you both prefer.These types of conversations can be difficult to have for some couples at least initially. Having structured conversations such as the ones I\\'ve described briefly above can feel awkward initially but the reason it can be helpful is because it can lead to further understanding in a way that decreases the chances of having an argument.Also consider seeing a therapist in your area who specializes in couples to discuss some of these ideas.

This does not mean that you have to identify as transgender but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resources.As far as telling your dad if that is particularly concerning for you I suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member (one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time) so that you can talk with some people to have support. This may help with two things: allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell him.One thing that I tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important conversation. That way you have greater chances of having the person\\'s attention and\\\\/or not needing to end the conversation quickly.Also please remember that you know yourself best as each of us does.

The reason I\\'m suggesting that it may be easier to have the conversations there is because sometimes the mental health professional can point out parts of conflict that are not easy for the people who are involved to actually see by themselves.If you want to try to talk with you mom to see how she is feeling maybe she would be willing to discuss it with you. If you\\'re going to have a conversation like that I would suggest you try these things:Ask her if this would be a good time to have an important conversation. If she says no consider asking her when would be a better time.Try to have the conversation with the goal of taking about five minutes to learn more about where she is coming from on this. If you can ask questions to learn more about that you may be able to know more about what she is thinking and feeling.This doesn\\'t mean that you have to agree with her but just that you are able to hear where she is coming from.Try to ask questions that start with the words who what how where when.

If you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex but maybe not.

Also if you know what leads up to your anxiety it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns.As for forgetting things you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious.

It\\'s also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related.Something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort.Another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety. One thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems (just for the regular physical) so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes.Also if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings.

For example in the grocery store if you are feeling anxious you could say to yourself I\\'m anxious right now and I\\'m okay while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other. No one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you.Anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it.

It\\'s also helpful to have people who you can talk to about your feelings and people who may be able to recognize things about you that you cannot see right now (such as how you are honest committed to your work a good listener etc.).This takes some time. Try to be gentle with yourself.

If not consider when in the next 24 to 48 hours would be a good time.It may also be helpful to discuss these ideas with a local therapist. The therapist may also be able to help both of you figure out where the anger is coming from and where she has learned to react this way.If it is abuse it may be even more difficult to have these important discussions.

It may be helpful to work through some of this with a local therapist so you can get more specific ideas.Some other things that come to my mind are maybe talking about spending about 10 minutes or so discussing how you are feeling and seeing if your partner is willing to listen. Then you could ask questions about how she would react if you were doing something she did not like. This allows you to react to information she is actually giving you rather than your perceptions that sound like they are different than what she is trying to tell you. This gives you the power to receive the messages that she is sending to you.I would also wonder where you have learned that there wasn\\'t much good out there for you and how you can stay present in the moment when you are with your girlfriend and see that she wants to be there with you.

Then once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from switch. It\\'s also good to restate what you think you are hearing. Then you know what each other is truly following about this. Also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming from.Also consider noticing what makes you feel valued special loved or appreciated.

END\",\"952\":\" Hello and thank you for your question. There are a couple of things I want to mention and some other colleagues may add other types of information. I want to talk about fantasies (an internal behavior notknown by others) versus external behaviors that others can see and your specific question about fantasizing about a parent. I am going to assume that you are meaning sexual fantasies and I apologize if that is not your meaning. It is important to remember that we may fantasize about a bunch of things that we would never do. Someone may fantasize about punching his boss right in the nose but would never do it. And not just because of the consequences but because they genuinely would notwant to hurt someone in real life. It is also true that some people fantasizeaboutthings as a way to work up to doing the actual thing they want to do. You may be in one of these categories. The specific issue of fantasizing about a mother is something commonly found in Sigmund Freud\\'s theories about psychosexual development. He called it the Oedipus Complex anddetermined itis generally found in early childhood development but canmove into adulthood.The reason I am sharing this with you isn\\'t to make you a psychology major but rather so that you will know that you are NOT the only person to have such fantasies in adulthood. Something to think about is whether or not you should feel guilty about fantasies. Of course if the answer is yes you may find yourself feelingguilty a lot of the time. Or should you only concern yourself with behaviors that others can actually see or be affected by? For example should you only be concerned if you are actually planning on ACTING on one of your fantasies toward your mother. The answer to that could certainly be yes since someone acting on their fantasies would certainly impact someone else. Sometimes our minds will have a fantasy and we recognize that it is taboo and when that happens it is possible that we will actually fantasize about it MORE. That is also a possibility here too. You may have had a rogue fantasy that has nowtaken root. The most important thing I am trying to get across to you is that there may be many reasons for these fantasies and they don\\'t all lead to them or you being bad. If you have real concerns about what this may mean about you as a person you may want to go to a counselor. This is especially true if you think you want to act on these fantasies and you know that would be harmful. There are many possible explanations for these fantasies and a counselor\\'s office may be the safest place to explore them. Be well.Robin J.

If you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms you may want to visit your primary care provider. They may tell you that they don\\'t see anything physically wrong with you and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience. A visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way. I work as a counselor in primary care and I promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse.

Self-diagnosing is something that we all do about one health issue or another. Taking a guess about what may or may not be happening to us is completely normal however the actual clinical diagnoses of a mental health disorder requires a licensed mental health professional. Here are a few reasons for this: 1. Making a clinical diagnosis often requires other things besidesmatching upthe symptoms of a disorder. To come to a diagnoses for any of the things you mentioned a counselorwould consult theDSM but theymay alsouse some type of screening tool assessment or scale. Many disorders have similarities and it requires someone with training to tease out the differences in the symptoms. 2. Our judgement is sometimes off when it comes to assessing ourselves. We really can\\'t be objective. Something as serious as determining a diagnosis really needs to be done by someone who has that objectivity. In addition once you know your diagnosis treating it usually requires help from a professional. 3. Sometimes the symptoms of a mental health disorder makes self-diagnoses impossible in and of itself. For example someone could be having hallucinations or delusions and not realize it. That would clearly make it impossible for them to diagnose themselves. There a many examples where something like this could happen with different mental health disorders. There are other reasons but these arethree important ones. Now does this mean that you are wrong about your diagnosis? Maybe not. You may be correct. Butit is important to get this confirmed by a professional mental health clinician.

Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out.

If he refuses you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn\\'t want to. I know the thought of that really hurts but it can save his life.

Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage they no longer want to commit suicide. But as you are indicating that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255.

After taking time to get to know them and learning about their view they have of themselves and others it is important to pick-up on more specific personality traits which comprehensively contribute to a personality type. Clinicians including myself often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent which indicate a type of personality. For example if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization needing to be on time planning and perfectionism these traits contribute to the type A personality.In addition to utilizing clinical judgment clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the DSM-5\\\\/ ICD-10.

Also notice how you\\'re feeling around the time you\\'re feeling bothered.These two indicators may show you patterns of when and to what you are especially sensitive.For example if you usually feel bothered at the end of a pressured day then take care to arrange as far as possible relatively unstimulated and quiet surroundings around this sensitive time.If your kids are of the age at which they have language skills then you can also take some pressure off yourself and them by explaining your inner state of mind in general terms.People including kids always do better with more information than not knowing what is going on in their lives. END\",\"1020\":\" Hello and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that you are struggling. I have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else. Depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions as you have experienced. This means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them. Treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling. Some people may take medication for the rest of their lives. Some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens. As you mentioned sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while but they can also come back. When they do it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication and\\\\/or to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned. Skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety. Many people report that they do this when they feel anxious and some say it calms them down. It is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so. These are ways to try to avoid escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression. That is a very normal thing to do. Nobody likes these feelings and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them. The problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a long-term solution. In fact they usually make things worse for many different reasons. Depression and anxiety can be treated but it is likely something you will need some help with. I would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression. Medication can be helpful but I still recommend counseling. The reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills. Be wellRobin J.

Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times (e.g. what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time).There could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxiety...maybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner that\\'s left him scared to try again (we call this operant conditioning). It could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers. Sometimes I refer to this as the hooker-housewife mentality where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love we treat that one differently almost up on a pedestal. Drives many partners crazy until they\\'re aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend\\\\/ girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them.It could also be that he\\'s not even aware that he\\'s not doing these things. If you haven\\'t asked him yet you might try gently approaching the subject when you\\'re not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you (or has enjoyed in the past or thinks he might enjoy). You can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him. Give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if he\\'d be down to go downtown. Baby it REALLY turns me on when you kiss me during sex.If you continue to get the impression that it\\'s somehow only about YOU or that he\\'s just really hesitant to talk about sex in general you might see if he\\'d be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy. END\",\"1022\":\" Depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be normal in the bedroom I can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you! It DOESN\\'T necessarily mean however that your husband is: gay bisexual transgender or even necessarily a cross-dresser etc. unless he has already told you so. I agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you.That being said what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isn\\'t always what we identify as. Lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture. For example many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly don\\'t consider themselves kinky submissive or anything else. It could be that your husband enjoys pretending\\\\/ fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband father son friend etc. Many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because it\\'s the opposite of what their life typically entails (e.g. a high profile CEO who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at the mercy of someone else once a week).Each of us has a sexual script - a blueprint if you will of what we like and don\\'t like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being normal. It\\'s also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression sexual orientation sexual behaviors sexual desires and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives (Gagnon &amp Simon 1973).You\\'ve been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment.ALL of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations. It\\'s like our own sex fingerprint.In my role as a couples counselor I often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ. If a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied the relationship thrives.Most counselors would agree that a healthy script includes:Both partners taking ownership for the couple\\'s sexual experiences.Both partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelings.Both partners learning to meet one another\\'s - needs desires and wishes while making sure his\\\\/her own needs are being met.If pegging your husband as it\\'s called is a hard and fast no for you that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script. However if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about needing to dress in a female fashion and\\\\/or be anally penetrated you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesn\\'t hurt either one of you or the marriage.My warmest wishes to you both!

For example:Where did you meet her?How long were you friends before you decided to call it quits?Why don\\'t you want to be friends with her (i.e. what do you mean by kind of crazy)? I promise this tends to matter to women.Were you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to her?If your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other woman\\'s hamburger and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has NOTHING to worry about she may start to come around.Now IF she\\'s more concerned that you might be taking this woman\\'s calls behind your back while I\\'m not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records you might print them off and highlight this female\\'s number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truth.And if you really want to step it up I would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place (e.g. little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages buy a rose or her favorite flower have her car detailed do the laundry...date nights...you get the idea).

The more you are able to be a witness to your emotions and thoughts the more you can learn to manage them. Your question offers several clues for strategies that you can try - for example identify the warning signs for becoming irritated and plan a response such as taking a deep breath informing the person you are becoming irritated and need some space or find a distraction temporarily like listening to music or going for a walk. Since you are aware of blaming others for things not working out you can proactively make a personal commitment to taking ownership or personal responsibility by just thinking about it and practicing thoughts such as I am responsible for my efforts and Blame is not helpful for anyone and other thoughts that you believe and can repeat related to this insight. When you practice thinking more rational healthy thoughts you are actually rewiring your brain so practice is key!

Another helpful piece of info on anxiety is that it is prone to something called symptom stress - being anxious about anxiety. If we could hear this symptom stress it might sound like Oh no I\\'m getting nervous about this I\\'m getting uptight I look nervous what if I have a panic attack! followed bymore cognitive distortions such as I can\\'t stand being anxious! and this is horrible!Theantidote to this is acceptance. Kind of like not stopping the waves but learning to surf instead (Jon Kabat-Zinn). If you happen to feel anxious say to yourself - this is just a reaction I\\'m having that is unpleasant but not horrible. I can tolerate and survive some anxiety I can breathe deeplyand I\\'ll be OK because panic attacks never killed anyone. I can stand this and it is temporary. You get the idea.We can increase our awareness of anxiety-provoking self-talk and counteract it with calming and reassuring self-talk. We have the ability to think about our thinking decide which thoughts are healthy and which are unhealthy and choose which to focus on. We brainwash ourselves with our thinking and according to self-perception theory  we learn what webelieve when we hear ourselves speak so we may as well be a calming reassuring presence in our own minds. :) END\",\"1043\":\" There is nothing wrong with going to summer school.

To that I often explain that if I stopped watching movies or better stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that I am delressed.

The emotional distance often makes us wonder: am I important to the other? These types of feelings need to be better understood in the context of your own background and upbringing I.e. who you are and also better understood in the context of your couple. Feeling reconnected can occur-- but there is not a one size fits all solutoon. As a first step do you or your partner have any ideas of how to feel reconnected?

END\",\"1073\":\" Your question highlights your pain very clearly.What you are describing is one of the most common scenarios I see in my practice with couples: One partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward.My mind immediately goes to a question for you: What happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for? What do you say to yourself about you about your spouse and about your relationship? What do you do in response to these feelings? Do you ask for what you need? Does this lead to arguments? Do you stay silent or withdraw?Very often couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship (and is often seen as cold and aloof towards the relationship) and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other (and is often seen as critical and nagging). Regardless of who started it these patterns canturn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship. If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together. As the patternsslow down partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities needs and longings and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesn\\'t leave the other partner feeling criticized threatened abandoned or uncared for.Some couples can do this without the help of a therapist. The book Hold Me Tight: 7 Conversations for a LIfetime of Love by Sue Johnson is a self-help book based on Emotionally Focused Therapy (the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists) and has been helpful to many couples that I see.

Given these statistics it is perfectly logical to be afraid. However there are things you can do to reduce the risk of rape such as being aware of your surroundings and limiting the use of drugs or alcohol.The Enhanced Access Knowledge Act program for college-aged women has been shown to reduce the risk of rape by more than 50%. (http:\\\\/\\\\/www.blueprintsprograms.com\\\\/factsheet\\\\/eaaa-enhanced-assess-acknowledge-act-sexual-assault-resistance-education) You may want to see if a program like this is available in your area.Another great app for when you need to walk somewhere alone is the Companion App (http:\\\\/\\\\/www.companionapp.io). Friends or family can track your progress from one point to another via the GPS in your phone.In addition talking with a counselor about your fears would also be a good idea. Sometimes fears are rational and reasonable. Sometimes they are over-reactions and unreasonable. When then are over-reactions and unreasonable they can have a negative impact on your life. In this case a counselor could help you understand why your fears are unreasonable and how you can stop them from negatively impacting your life.

First I want to say that it is great that you are are willing to admit that you share some responsibility in some of the relationship problems you are having. This isn\\'t always easy to do but it sure is important if you want to see improvement. It does sound cliche but communication really is the bedrock of relationships. And not just intimate partner relationships but really any relationship that is significant to us. It sounds like you are saying that you have a difficult time really listening to what your partner is telling you and then responding in a way that is helpful. I want to tell you that you are not alone. Good communication skills are not really something you are born with we actually have to learn them. The good news is that there is great information available to help you do that. Ultimately some people must seek professional help through couple\\'s counseling in order to get help with this process. This is because some of the hurt and anger could be at such a level already that you may need help setting boundaries creating a plan learning new skills and staying on track. If that is not something you can afford or can do right now here are a few suggestions that may help. Personally I am big fan of Dr. John Gottman. He is an expert in relationships and wrote a really great easy-to-read book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. Dr. Gottman discusses the kind of communication that healthy couples seem to have which can be helpful and worth trying. You can buy Dr. Gottman\\'s book on Amazon for under $9. It\\'s a good deal. There are a variety of websites that have good information that may help you build your communication. Here is one that I found that has a few good tips. http:\\\\/\\\\/www.helpguide.org\\\\/articles\\\\/relationships\\\\/effective-communication.htm You can try them and see if they are helpful. It is important to remember that like all new skills communication requires practice and we surely fail several times before we start getting good at it. If you were ever a pitcher in baseball then you know you have to throw thousands of pitches before you really start hitting your strike zone consistently. Allow yourself to make mistakes own them and start again. I hope these suggestions help and good luck.Robin Landwehr DBH LPCC  END\",\"1099\":\" Thanks for your question. Becoming a good listener is an essential piece in being a better communicator.

Do you find yourself becoming defensive when she brings up issues? Do you often find yourself thinking of what you want to say next? Do you take her words personally preventing you from having the ability to problem solve?Here are some tips that may help you with being a better listener:1. Concentrate on what you are hearing not on what you will say next.2. Ask questions if you need clarification or don\\'t understand.3. Summarize what you\\'re hearing after every couple of minutes to make sure that you\\'re not missing anything.4. Ask your partner what she needs from you.

These questions usually begin with words like who what where when. Questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way. You can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicateThen you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience. You could also start by talking about something that is important to you.Remember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesn\\'t mean that you agreeAlso try sticking to one subject at a time. It\\'s difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or twoTry to use the word want or wish instead of need. Saying that you need something (or if your girlfriend would say that) that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation. That takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to changeSomething else to try would be using some sort of timeout. Consider this:Discuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts. Timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five 10 15 minutes or maybe even an hour. When there are a lot of emotions happening each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceiving.When using timeout say to your girlfriend (or she can say to you) I need an hour before we can go back to this. Then actually come back to the discussion.Some people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way. This is why the agreement is important before you need it.While it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practice.Try to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants wishes and desires while recognizing those of your partner.As one final idea consider spending about 15 minutes a week together where you are not problem-solving about anything just connecting with one another.I encourage you to see a therapist who specializes in couples if you would like some more specific ideas for what is happening within each of you and between you.Best wishes!

Continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesn\\'t.2. Validating. You tell her you you understanding why she feels this way. (If you don\\'t understand then find a way.)

That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault. This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the long-term. Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wife\\'s side of the story I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns.One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified. It may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity. Currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hook-up chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing. Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities. If there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying I feel you distancing from me. In other words it\\'s not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her. Often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness. If so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally. If this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again. Otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs.The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart. The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean you\\'re so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie. The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker. You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife. If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said. If she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much. Therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark. Rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings? You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you? Is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife? That said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities. She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fears.The last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting she\\'s wrong. Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong. In the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem. Unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy. This pattern can also trigger the partners\\' insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory - creating a vicious cycle. Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment. This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding. We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of I\\'m sorry. However it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that. In my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says I\\'m sorry I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability. If neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesn\\'t do it.? These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating.For more information about these services you are welcome to read my materials on my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca or to contact me at (514) 690-2469.

If you or your husband would like to have sex more often I suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied. The aspect of connectedness is an important one. While sex can be very connecting for many couples it isn\\'t the only way to connect.

Indeed despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable it is also part of the excitement of trying something new. Many people who engage in open polyamorous and\\\\/or other-type relationships will tell you that difficult feelings such as jealousy and anger do show up sometimes. This doesn\\'t prove that there is something wrong with the relationship it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one. And many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work. Of course all relationships take work so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception. There could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do. One reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are. Some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this. Another reason this may be bothering you is because on some level you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages. They are supposed to be monogamous heterosexual etc. etc. Just because you may not agree with these beliefs doesn\\'t mean that you haven\\'t been influenced by them. We all have. Another reason this may be upsetting you is because it may feel a little frightening. Perhaps there are a lot of What ifs going on in your mind. When you get the empty feeling it may be helpful to try to really nail down the emotions that are attached to that feeling. One thing that I do think is very important is that you communicate these feelings to your husband. It may even be a good idea to talk about expectations or ground rules if you will. It is important that you are both on the same page about what this is and why you are doing it. If you continue to struggle I suggest finding a counselor who has experience in sex and sexuality.

It takes courage and work to be vulnerable. My guess is that you have been shown in your lifetime that being vulnerable (ie expressing yourself) is unsafe. My assumption would be you have been criticized or ignored when you have expressed yourself in the past it has taught your emotional self to simply not do it again. This is a normal protective mechanism that you have used to cope with past feelings of hurt. It will take time and work to engage again in an emotional way.I would start my practicing and identifying how you feel to yourself. Check in with yourself multiple times a day to gage where you are at emotionally. After you feel you have a good grasp on this start to engage in emotional conversations with others. Choose others that feel safe to you a good friend that knows you well or a sibling or family member. Expressing yourself is a behavior that you have suppressed out of protection so you can choose to engage in safe emotional expression behaviors just the same. Best of luck!  END\",\"1114\":\" As someone who specializes in sexuality and polyamory I can tell you that your experience is incredibly common. It can be helpful to keep in mind that alcohol lowers our inhibitions and for first time threesomes or any new sexual behavior really we humans tend to enjoy a little extra oomph to our courage levels. That being said it also lowers our ability to make well thought-out decisions. This combined with the brain rewarding novelty (new lover new experience with our partner etc.) and maybe even some over-zealousness and performance anxiety could likely explain why your husband was on her more than you. My encouragement to you is to try not to overthink it at this stage. Now IF you two choose to bring her or someone else into the bedroom again and a similar thing keeps happening I would definitely push the issue and see what\\'s up from his perspective.The empty feeling could be any number of things including:Fear that you\\'re not enough for himFear that she\\'s better than you in some wayFear that if we keep doing this thing he will need it and what happens if I no longer want it?Opposite fear of what if I now want her more than him or if I want the threesomes and he doesn\\'t?Fear of does this mean our sex life isn\\'t good enough as it is?....do we have to always add a little spice to keep it hot?Or like Robin alluded to preconceived notions about what culture religion family and friends etc. say about what marriage and sex should look like.

You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a long-distance relationship. Although maintaining a long-distance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many long-distance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection.Without knowing more about the complicated nature of your relationship I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else. Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him? Or is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence? Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future. The more you focus on what if situations the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure.However if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a long-distance relationship. To help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust. Is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment? For many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and Skype. It\\'s hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner and it\\'s hard to build a relationship when you don\\'t know what\\'s going on in your partner\\'s life. Other times it is Making sure they talk often to their long-distance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence.. Regular communication understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship but this is especially true for long-distance ones.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca END\",\"1116\":\" You\\'re right that long-distance relationships can be complicated. If he loves you and you love him that\\'s a great start. I wonder if you would be able or willing to have a discussion about what you love about each other and what makes each of you feel loved valued special and appreciated.When having important discussions consider the following:Make sure it is a good time to have a discussion (and if you\\'re doing it in writing because of the distance you could type something in the top of the message about not reading any further if the person who is reading doesn\\'t have 10 minutes or something like that)Try to listen as though you are an investigative reporter trying to find out information about each other. Asking more questions in this manner can be a helpful way to be less defensive during difficult or emotional conversations.When having discussions face-to-face I often recommend using timeout when things become very emotional and saying that you agree to go back to the conversation in 15 minutes or one hour or some short duration of time that allows for some of the immediate emotions to dissipate so it is easier to also talk about them. As for how that translates to distance maybe each of you would say that you are working on figuring out how best to explain it and will answer the next time you have access to the Internet (or if possible use some kind of timeframe).Consider what questions you would like answers to. For example are you wondering:What should I do if I miss you or want to talk to you more? I don\\'t want to make you feel guilty but I also don\\'t want to hide my feelings. Can I share them with you?If you have days or weeks when we cannot be in contact directly can I keep sending you messages or is that overwhelming?How will you ask for support from me?Some couples really want to protect each other. In doing so instead of hiding our emotions can we share them and work through them together?Whatever else comes to mind.Gary Chapman is famous for his books about the 5 Love Languages. He has one specifically for military families:The 5 Love Languages Military Edition: The Secret to Love That Lasts.Here\\'s a list of books related to loving from a distance:http:\\\\/\\\\/www.longdistancerelationships.net\\\\/bookstor.htmI have not read these books myself but I have read other works by a lot of the authors.One final tip: Consider making a list of times when you work together and both feeling calm safe and comfortable.

It\\'s based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason (support openess understanding empathy) you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive. How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him. If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance. If he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide. Either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that. If he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actions.Dr. Virginia Chowwww.PsychologyResource.ca END\",\"1122\":\" This happens slowly and can be done.You already are at the first step of realizing that you hate yourself not that the feelings of self-loathing are the best of what you\\'re able to expect from life.A way to start building confidence is to pay close attention to the way you handle interactions and make decisions.If you start to notice what you\\'d like from an interaction and afterwards reflect on how well you handled yourself especially with any unexpected circumstances you\\'ll build confidence in your ability to be good at something.Do you know why you hate yourself?This answer may help you address within yourself  a new type self talk which has more positives in it than what you\\'ve been accustomed to telling yourself.

Sometimes we come across something that scares us we push through it and suddenly we aren\\'t afraid anymore. But sometimes it can seem like our fears just take over and we cannot overcome them. There are some options:1. You can go to a counselor and receive some type of treatment. What kind of treatment would depend on the type of fears you are experiencing. For example if you have a general phobia about something they may use various techniques to help you manage it. 2. There are different websites and even some self-help books that you can use to try to overcome your fears. When it comes to overcoming certain fears or phobias exposure therapy well-studied and proven to work. A therapist would help you with this but some websites give instructions for how to do it yourself. I am not sure how well it works when you try it by yourself but here is a link to a website that does offer some tools. http:\\\\/\\\\/psychology.tools\\\\/anxiety.htmlSome colleagues may offer you some other types of advice.

Generally the lack of connection can occur when you don\\'t feel heard understood or valued. These are common emotional needs that result in a good and secure emotional connection that reduces feelings of loneliness.You mentioned that they listen but don\\'t understand. Do you communication clearly about what you need emotionally (understood accepted valued heard empathized)? To help you ask for the right type of support you can ask yourself what it is about the situation that is bothering you and how you would wish for your friends and family to respond to you. The result may be an answer that is more informative to your loved ones. For example you might say Thank you for listening to me.

Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do. I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important. Here are a few things I would suggest:1. Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed. Sometimes we will set a goal like I want to be more confident but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it. Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence. Whatever your change of behavior is make sure it is something you can actually change. 2. If you are going to give up a behavior decide what you are going to do in place of it. So if you are going to stop showing up late for work then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual. 3. If you are going to make changes really nail down WHY you want to make them. What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person? For example if you have the goal of weight loss the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value self-care. Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there. 4. Once you know WHY you want to make these changes I strongly suggest setting small goals. If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse. So make the goal small realistic and guided by the the things you want to be as a person. 5. As Sherry mentioned finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck. Any counselor who does work with goal-setting and motivation can probably help.

Thank you for sharing your heart here. I want to start off by saying in kind of an ironic way your struggle is something many people go through I might say quite often. Many feel alone with one another quite frequently. THe reasons for feeling alone vary much between person to person. In reading how you presented things I will just respond from how this strikes me. Sometimes feeling alone might be the result of not completing the second half of the equation meaning that although people listen it wont necessarily equate the elimination of being alone. Instead its whenyou follow up by inquiring and listening to others thatyou may discover they feel and think and struggle just like you do.And as a result you discover you really were never alone when people discover common struggle and feelings we are connected. Second we as humans are sometimes feeling alone because we may be lacking some self-acceptance. Not fully accepting myself or situation  can be in the way of feeling the presence of others or the hearing the voice of others too.Or in other words not bein\\'ok\\' withmyself makes it difficult being with others. Third feeling alone may be us not clear on what we are really needing from another person? These are just some thoughts to consider. Aloneness feels so real and yet it has much to do with our perspective and view of things... we are all alone in a crowded world until we speak and listen more closely.Kindly-keith hughes M.A. keithcounseling.com  END\",\"1130\":\" Feelings of anxiety can be scary and sometimes we\\'re not aware of the triggers that lead up to moments of anxiety i. e. heart racing sweaty palms sweating shortness of breath. It\\'s important to realize that in moments of anxiety our body &amp mind are experiencing a reaction from our primal or reptilian brain that is signaling the flight or fight response within us which kicks the hypothalamus into action flooding our body with chemicals like adrenaline or cortisol. So one way to work with anxiety is to find out what the triggers are that lead to anxiety such as fear stress. negative thought patterns not enough food or sleep. Keeping a daily journal can help you track the patterns and triggers and once you identify the triggers you can ameliorate them by learning new skills &amp techniques and by reducing stress and getting enough sleep. One quick way to reduce anxiety is by taking deeper breathes sometimes this is called belly breathing. When you breath in make sure your belly rises and expands and as you breath out the belly deflates. Many of us do shallow breathing up in our chest which does not allow for a full breath and getting a full breath is so important as a tool to help relax us in times of stress &amp anxiety . END\",\"1131\":\" Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real. I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts. The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them. I also realize that might seem really hard to do but here\\'s a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work. Thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine. Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we don\\'t pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way i.e. scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety. So how do we work or stop those scary thought streams? One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen he wrote the book Buddha\\'s Brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts. Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts. There are reasons that our brain works this way but I don\\'t have time to go into all of that in this response. So it\\'s just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time. If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought.

It sounds like you have already started to answer your own question by stating that you love cross dressing very much and I am glad you enjoy it! Cross dressing is something many people enjoy and there is no harm in it whatsoever.My question to you would be: What is making you feel torn about it? There is unfortunately still a lot of negative stigma associated with people who express their gender or sexuality in ways that differ from the majority. (And sometimes certain sexual interests are actually very common or even in the majority but because people carry shame about being different when it comes to gender and sexuality we assume we are all alone!)Being a sexual or gender minority or someone who participates in kink or expresses their sexuality or gender identity in a unique and personal way often means suffering from something called internalized oppression. We grow up being exposed to certain assumptions and beliefs about what is acceptable behavior and even face consequences sometimes if we don\\'t fit in the way others tell us to. Even if those assumptions are harmful and wrong we still internalize them and feel guilty about who we are. There is nothing wrong with us but feeling stigmatized and isolated can lead to feelings of shame embarrassment or like something is wrong with us.But there is absolutely nothing wrong with you so be proud of who you are and what you enjoy.

If he accepts this challenge then that is a good sign you are on the path toward healing your relationship. Also please don\\'t ever forget that regardless of what led him to cheat it was his decision to take that action rather than addressing whatever issues he was having in your relationship. Couples affected by betrayal typically have some underlying issue(s) whether it is a lack of connection or intimacy or another factor and it is possible to heal and grow even stronger as a couple after betrayal. Because you are grieving though allow yourself to acknowledge and accept your feelings of hurt and pain as they will likely come in waves but the pain will lessen over time and with supportive therapy along with the commitment to repair your relationship-from both you and your husband.Also in regards to your concern about hurting your children keep in mind that parents model healthy relationship behavior for their children. If your relationship with your husband remains disconnected untrusting or bitter your children will see that and not only feel sad that their parents are both suffering but also grow up feeling that experiencing such ongoing pain is tolerable or even normal in a relationship.

Therefore I think we may have a different understanding of the definition of long distance relationship which makes it hard for me to adequately answer this question for you.I don\\'t know how old you are but if you\\'re an adult after two and a half years I don\\'t think it\\'s unreasonable to have an open and honest talk with each other about where the relationship is going and what you both want and expect. Long distance relationships are difficult to keep alive because you don\\'t ever see each other in person. Talking texting and video chatting isn\\'t enough and the longer the physical distance remains the more difficult it becomes to keep an emotional closeness. It may be time to evaluate the situation figure out when (if ever) the two of you will be able to be together in person and if you can and want to wait that long. Do you both want the same things out of life? If one of you wants to take the relationship to the next level but the other doesn\\'t then it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s long distance or not - if you aren\\'t on the same page with the relationship it is going to be difficult to make it work.Trust is important. Issues with trust insecurity jealousy lying and\\\\/or hiding things from each other being afraid to speak up and have an honest conversation - these things can ruin relationships if not addressed. I know confrontation of any sort can be hard for some people but it is necessary at times. Evaluate your true feelings for him. Are you with him for reasons other than love such as being afraid to be alone or thinking you wouldn\\'t be able to find someone else? Has he ever given you reason to be suspicious of his female coworkers or friends before? Some people unfortunately develop a track record of indiscretions and give their significant others ample reason for distrusting them.

Sometimes what\\'s best for a person is the hardest thing to do and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don\\'t happen in a vacuum. If you\\'ve had any experience with addicts at all then I\\'m sure you\\'ve heard the term enabler. A lot of the times when people think they\\'re helping they\\'re actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use\\\\/drink continuing to do so or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use\\\\/drink in the first place and not only break the physical addiction to it but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don\\'t pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn\\'t need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment.

Fear is not always a bad thing and in fact can be quite healthy and appropriate depending on the situation.A phobia however is different. You used the term fear rather than phobia. A phobia is an irrational fear - meaning it is not rational for you to fear that thing. If your situation is a phobia exposure therapy can help. This consists of gradually exposing yourself a little at a time to the thing you are afraid of. Some people with phobias find that the irrational fear interferes with their life and they do need to overcome it. Someone who is afraid to drive over bridges may go to great lengths to avoid routes that have bridges. People who are afraid of elevators may always use the stairs instead which may not always be feasible. If overcoming a phobia will improve the quality of your life then by all means seek professional help to overcome it.Everyone has fears or things that make them nervous. Public speaking asking a person out fear of failure. Examine what your fear is and try to determine the reason for the fear. When you can get to the root cause of the fear you can deal with that issue. A lot of times it is a self-esteem issue. You may be able to peel back the layers of the fear and find out what\\'s causing it and deal with the real issue.Some fears are caused by trauma. Someone with PTSD is going to have an exaggerated fear response and will find themselves being kicked into fight or flight mode over things that someone without the trauma experience wouldn\\'t notice or react to. In cases like this exposure therapy would be the wrong approach and could actually make things worse. If there is a possibility that a past trauma is the cause of your fear I strongly urge you to seek a therapist - not just any therapist but one who is trained to work with trauma and abuse victims. END\",\"1143\":\" The answer would require a more in-depth knowledge of you and your situation.A lot of times these feelings are the result of the people in your life treating you a certain way. You internalize it and accept it as your reality.The first step is to evaluate the people close to you especially your parents. Even if you are an adult think back to your childhood. Children who grow up in an unstable home often grow up to be adults with insecurities and emotional problems. The obvious such as being abused can certainly lead to a person having little to no confidence and self esteem but there are other situations that might surprise you to hear they can be damaging to a person.You may have never been physically or sexually abused but what about emotionally? Were you yelled at berated put down? Were you told you\\'d never amount to anything? Were you compared to siblings and felt like you always fell short couldn\\'t live up to expectations? When you hear something over and over again you start to believe it.Maybe you weren\\'t yelled at. Maybe it was the opposite. Studies show that children who grow up with a parent who is depressed show signs of emotional neglect. A chronically depressed mother for example may have seemed cold detached emotionless. She may have been less likely to show interest in a child\\'s life not give praise for accomplishments or show support by going to ballgames or performances.If one of your family members were chronically ill while you were growing up chances are a lot of the attention went to them which could have led to your needs not being met.Any of these situations could cause a person to grow up feeling unimportant unheard unloved or like they don\\'t matter.Maybe nothing I\\'ve described here fits your situation. If you can\\'t pinpoint what has caused you to feel this way on your own a counselor can help.I am not saying blame it on your parents or telling you there\\'s nothing you can do to change it! Quite the opposite! Understanding WHY you feel that way is a first step towards making the changes needed to feel better. Cognitive behavior therapy focuses on cognition - figure out the WHY. Then behavior - the HOW. END\",\"1144\":\" Are you old enough to move out?

You can choose NOT to allow him to make you feel anything. It really is that simple. By looking at it as a choice you make you will be empowered to take control over your emotions and learn to feel better about yourself because your self-worth will no longer be defined by what someone else says about you or how they treat you.Let me say that again in a different way: Your self-worth is NOT defined by someone else. The way he treats you is a reflection of who he is as a person - not you. Don\\'t take ownership of that!I understand that if you are a minor setting healthy boundaries and refusing to accept this kind of treatment can be difficult. Reach out to others for help. But if you are 18 and over there is absolutely no excuse for you to be there having to put up with maltreatment. Put up some boundaries and create the distance needed to protect yourself emotionally. You owe it to yourself and deserve to live a healthy happy life. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong. END\",\"1145\":\" I sympathize with you! It is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other and can lead to discord in the relationship. The good news is there are ways to deal with this.You may have already answered your question. There are many medications that can alter one\\'s sex drive. If your birth control pills are the cause of this talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand. You may even consider alternate methods for birth control such as condoms.However there are some other things to ask yourself. First you used the term affection but then talked about sex. They\\'re not the same thing. There are different kinds of intimacy and many different ways to show love for someone. A book you might find useful is The Five Love Languages.Defining what affection means to you and to him and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other may help lessen some of your anxiety over this.Humans are hard-wired to need appropriate physical touch. In fact studies have shown that newborns\\\\/premies who can receive skin-on-skin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who don\\'t receive this touch. It\\'s called Kangaroo Care.Children who have grown up in neglectful environments where they\\'re not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when they\\'re adults. One question to ask yourself is were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication? If so there may be other deeper issues at play here.For someone who has received the wrong kind of sexual\\\\/physical touch (sexual abuse physical beatings) it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you. A therapist could help you work through this.Sometimes a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship. Once those issues are resolved the sex drive comes back. Examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy if you\\'ve been arguing a lot or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressed.Finally look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a non-sexual way. You may be doing things for each other that you don\\'t even realize and noticing these will help you appreciate it more. Take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways. Some people like to give gifts do the other person\\'s chores or do other things they think the person will appreciate.If after all of this you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful. It is a very common issue for a lot of couples.

We would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie Batman Begins Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them.

END\",\"1152\":\" I think there are many different directions we could go as far as answering your question. I think the first and most important question you need to ask yourself is do you truly believe in your heart that you can forgive him and trust him again? Once you answer that question honestly then you can move in one of two directions. First if you truly love this guy and see yourself being with him long term and for the long haul so to speak...and you genuinely want to forgive him and trust him again that is completely do-able and possible if you both put in the work. But there\\'s a greater issue here that needs to be addressed. You say your relationship is good but there\\'s been a sexual disconnect between the two of you and that usually indicates some type of emotional disconnect is at the core. Would you agree with that or what are your thoughts? Were you giving him less sexual attention than you normally do or were you guys never on the same page about sexual needs and having compatible sex drives? If you are more of an emotional person than he is you may have been less interested sexually because he hasn\\'t been meeting your emotional needs. For instance if you hadn\\'t been feeling loved cared about validated appreciated cherished and special to him than you may have felt less connected physically and been less interested. This is a common issue with couples and can easily be addressed if the communication in your relationship is strong and you can find a way to express to him your frustrations. In essence many women tend to have more emotional needs than men this is the way we are hard-wired and there are exceptions to this of course but if you have been feeling neglected emotionally than your lack of interest in sex is actually completely understandable and NORMAL! Until he understands this and can learn to tune into your needs emotionally you may struggle with feeling you are out of sync emotionally (and sexually). This leads to you both being frustrated but if all this is ringing true to you he seriously probably has no clue what\\'s going on and may not know how you\\'re feeling. You need to communicate your needs to him if you are super lost with how to do that there\\'s an awesome book called The Five Love Languages. It\\'s not that long and it\\'s very approachable and easy to apply the concepts to your relationships. Invaluable resource for relationships and truly eye opening really!!This is a long post I\\'m sorry! But this is such an important issue that is very common and many people feel lost about how to handle it. So back to the second direction you can go....you feel very betrayed you aren\\'t sure if you can ever trust him again and you see yourself perhaps being paranoid forever and never being able to completely get over this. For instance if he says he is working late or if he doesn\\'t call or text right away when he usually does you may immediately jump to the worst case scenario that he is cheating again. Of course it may not be true he may have legit reasons for his behaviors but the point is if you are going to be in paranoia-mode OR you just will always be unsure whether he loves you and is committed to you and only you then the trust may not be able to be re-built. You need to think long and hard about this and if you decide you have the capacity to forgive him and rebuild your foundation of trust and honesty then you need to let him know very explicitly what you need him to do to earn that trust back. You can\\'t just tell him vaguely I need to trust you again if he wants his family back and he\\'s willing to do the work you need to line out exactly what he needs to do and he needs to do it. But be prepared that he might throw out there that he cheated because he felt you weren\\'t attracted to him anymore (or he tries to put the blame on you somehow because he says you weren\\'t meeting his physical needs)...if he throws that out there but you weren\\'t showing him the affection because you were frustrated emotionally then it all starts with you communicating that to him. Get that book!In conclusion if you feel in your heart there is no way you will be able to trust him again and you will always wonder if he\\'s cheating when his behavior isn\\'t spot on you will be a nervous wreck and perhaps cutting your losses now would spare you the continued heartache. There is certainly a way to work through this but you both have to be motivated and you have to get to the source of why the cheating happened in the first place. Rebuilding trust can be a long process maybe even years and for some people they may never be able to fully trust and let go of the past. I truly recommend starting with the book and then going from there. If you decide you want to stay with him you would really benefit from couples counseling as it sounds like a professional could help you strengthen your communication and ability to trust again.

If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot. Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly.Over time a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own. You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you don\\'t create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you.

Studies have been done that show that 80% of human thoughts are negative so you are not alone.I like to think of thoughts as a tornado... if you are in a tornado you are completely consumed by it and it is nearly impossible to do anything beneficial. However when you are let\\'s say a mile away from a tornado it is still scary but you have the option to do something that is important to you such as get shelter or make sure your family and friends are safe.When unhelpful or scary thoughts arise we tend to start a war with them which is the equivalent of jumping into the tornado. This makes the thoughts and emotions bigger and intensifies the feelings that go with them.So the question I imagine you have is how do I get out of the tornado? There are 3 steps to doing this:Get distance from your thoughts by adding I am noticing I\\'m having the thought that.... to the front of them. For example I am noticing I am having the thought that something bad is going to happen to me. The purpose of this is not to decrease your fear or get rid of the thought. These thoughts might always be there and that is okay because that is how the mind naturally works so struggling with that is a waste of time and energy. The purpose is to gain some distance from the thoughts so you don\\'t get swept away by them. You can imagine them floating along like leaves in a stream or clouds in the sky (and often the same thought will come back again and again but that\\'s okay... just continue to notice it with curiosity). I imagine the thoughts get in your way of doing what really matters to you so if you can get a little bit of distance you can do things that are fulfilling and meaningful to you.Tune into your body and notice what sensations come up and where you feel them most intensely. Then breathe into them and make room for them. Our 5 main emotions are: joy sadness fear\\\\/anxiety shame and anger. ALL of these emotions are part of being human and there is no escaping them. So again struggling with them ends up intensifying them. Instead let them be and make a little bit of room for them. Often a side effect of this is the intensity will decrease but it might not. The purpose is to keep them from becoming more intense.Contact the present moment. Notice what is happening here and now. One way of doing this is tuning into the five senses. What are some things you hear see taste smell and feel? Another way is to notice what is happening in your body (without trying to change it). How deep are your breaths what is happening with your heart rate are you cold\\\\/warm etc?Implementing these three steps can help you to refrain from getting caught up in your unhelpful thoughts. Unfortunately there is no way to get rid of thoughts or feelings completely. So the only option that works in the long run is to accept them while continuing to do what matters to you and what is fulfilling to you.I hope this helps! END\",\"1162\":\" Fear is a part of life.

It\\'s a great question and one that many people want to know the answer to. The short answer is YES! Counseling can be very helpful to people struggling with many different things. There has been a lot of research conducted to prove that counseling is an effective way to help people with mental health concerns life stressors and many other issues. In addition there are many people who would tell you that counseling made a positive profound impact on their lives. Indeed some would tell you that counseling saved their lives. Now not everyone would tell you that counseling helped. But when you think about it there are many medical treatments for a variety of healthcare issues that also do not help everyone. So is counseling guaranteed? No. But it is something that is worth trying if someone is suffering or is just wanting some perspective or support. Also there is many different types of counseling. Different counselors have different styles and have different training for various issues. This means that you are likely to find someone who has a good style and expertise in an area that you want to work on. If you don\\'t know where to go I suggest contacting your state\\'s counseling association. They can help. I think the real question that most people have is how? How does it help? That question is a bit more complicated because there are many different models of counseling\\\\/therapy that work in different ways. What I can tell you is that regardless of the model of counseling the relationship between counselor and client is the most important factor. I don\\'t mean that the relationship has to be ooowy goowy... but it does have to be one where there is trust and openness. A counselor will spend time to make sure that you are working together as a team toward a common goal. If you go to counseling and you don\\'t feel this is the case tell your counselor. An ethical counselor will welcome your feedback. I hope this is helpful please ask more questions! I hope some colleagues add some other thoughts too. Be wellRobin J.

For some this process can take a very long winding path of self-discovery while for others they are seeking a purposeful solution-based way to approach and manage a specific problem. It\\'s important to remember that there are different styles of therapy some of which will work great with some but poorly with others specifically to help those to decide how they wish to move forward. I often recommend speaking with a number of therapists before beginning treatment to find out more about how they practice in order to make sure their style aligns with your goals.On a more specific note there is myriad research out in the world that indicates both counselling and medication can have an affect on changing our moods and behaviours. However medication is not an effective way of treating the problem as it treats the symptoms of that problem (increased anxiety lowered mood etc.) and research has shown that the most effective route for better mental health care comes from a combination of counselling and medication. END\",\"1170\":\" There are multiple ways that counseling helps people. The most basic is that it gives you someone to talk to about and through what you are facing. It is better than a friend because this is a space for your stuff and you get to focus on what you need and don\\'t have to worry about the other side. This is also a place where you do not have to worry about how else the other person is involved in the situation. Beyond this basic level a counselor will have expertise they can bring in terms of how people including you can effectively deal with this kind of situation. The counselor may also be aware of connections that you would not otherwise see. A good counselor will also recognize if and when you need other help or support in the situation. Why wouldn\\'t you benefit from having someone walk with you in your journey to peace and wholeness.

Perhaps they can help you to practice talking about your insecurities with your friends.Another way is to start slowly to dress more and more like yourself and your true body shape. Some of your friends may make fun of you true but then you must ask yourself...why do you want to be friends with people like that? END\",\"1172\":\" A car accident can be a traumatic event. Especially if it was serious you could have feared for your life felt everythingvwas out of control and had normal reactions to an abnormal situation afterwards.This may or may not be related to the traumas that you experienced in the military. If it is then it is possible that you will see a direct effect in triggering off PTSD symptoms. Even if it didn\\'t it is possible that the complexity of the two situations will interact inside you to be a combined response.Having already been diagnosed with PTSD this might be a good time to reconnect with the help system you had around military experiences and explore it a little bit about the new experience. The right exploration does not have to make things worse and can be a good source of prevention.

The best route forward would be to seek out counselling admittedly but if your insurance deductible is too high that can be very expensive. I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program (EAP) if offered by your employer. If not you can look into community centres for counselling options check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization.If however you are motivated to get your depression under control there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist (as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or CBT) such as Mind Over Mood.

Of course I am a therapist so I would think that! :) Seriously - I think therapy and counseling allow us to understand ourselves our motivations and the things that bring us happiness and discontent.

Informed consent clinics (at least in California) do not require letters or therapy as part of the process.  END\",\"1181\":\" Such a great question! I\\'m so sorry you are struggling! You may be experiencing Intrusive thoughts. These are thoughts that seem to come from no where and victimize us. I can strongly recommend a book called When Panic Attacks by Dr. David Burns. It helps you to identify the thoughts and the help you create ways to counteract them! There is another technique called Thought Stopping. Thought Stopping can be as simple as saying Stop! loudly (if you are alone) or in your head if you are in public. It\\'s a quick way to distract you from the distressing thought and allow you to refocus. I recommend using this technique followed by some deep breathing while visualizing something that helps you feel relaxed (a favorite place a pet etc.). These three things in conjunction can be of great assistance.One key component in addressing anxious thinking is building the skill of relaxation. I recommend an App called Headspace which teaches relaxation through some simple guided mediation. Super easy to do and a great way to begin to build relaxation skills. Plenty of sleep and reducing caffeine intake can also be things to explore. Hope this helps!  END\",\"1182\":\" Counseling definitely helps people!

END\",\"1183\":\" Sexual desire seems to be straightforward - I like someone and I become aroused at the thoughts of being intimate with them - but that idea does not always take into account other factors.Stress can have a huge effect on our body and how it performs. When we are overstressed for example we often find ourselves ill at the same time. Can you think of any part of your world that may be causing you some additional stress? Additionally focusing on your erection may also be increasing the level of stress you feel about being intimate which could also effect your ability to get and maintain an erection. While this may seem counter intuitive it makes sense in the word of stress!Finally it\\'s never a bad idea to follow up with your doctor as well. You did not mention your age or sexual history outside of this relationship but it is always a good idea to check in with medical staff to make sure there is nothing physically responsible for changes in our body as well. END\",\"1184\":\" Seasonal Affective Disorder (S.A.D.) is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons especially fall to winter. Everyone suffers with some form of this (lessened activity levels increased isolation etc.) while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression. If you have noticed that this happens frequently there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward:1. Attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood. It\\'s important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools.2. Push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities. It\\'s easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly. Perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights complete with hot chocolate and a fire?3. You may want to consider the purchase of a S.A.D. Light. These are lights that expose you to additional ultra violet light to increase the vitamin D in our bodies as well as the release of growth hormone (which releases when we wake up). There are mixed reviews of these products however and they can be expensive. END\",\"1185\":\" I couldn\\'t help but notice that you did not specify your age so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own. Unfortunately it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm.From what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage. Often when I am working with those who offer the same concern there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress. When we are trying to make others happy especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming.Stress management is just that management of our own anxieties about the needs of others about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly. For example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time.Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example does a certain person\\'s style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity? Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.

END\",\"1189\":\" This is something I have had to address with individuals often since working with couples is one of my practice\\'s focuses. The answer can depend upon several reasons all which tend to be explored while in session. If you or your counselor utilizes an integral approach in which one of the main premises makes sure to check the four irreducible perspectives (subjective intersubjective objective and interobjective \\\\u2013 also known as the four quadrants) in determining where the challenges are it then becomes possible to identify what might be contributing to or causing the challenge as well as offering up ways to address the situation.In this case from the upper-right or behavioral and physical perspective we would want to make sure there is no physical limitation or ailment meaning that you would need to visit your doctor and have the basics checked (such as blood pressure. We would also look at particular behaviors to see if you are doing something with is effecting performance (such as masturbating often or being influenced by pornography).Next we would look at the upper left quadrant (thoughts cognitions identity feelings) to look at what is going on here both during sexual activities and at other times. If you are worried about your job your family or under immense pressure to perform at work or while intimate this can contribute to your situation. From there we would turn to the lower left quadrant (cultural rules and tools) to see who you have learned to interpret challenges that come up during sex and look for ways to shift update and\\\\/or reshape the way you view sex and its challenges. It would be here that we would see whether one is even comfortable using a service like counseling based upon how your family\\\\/culture of origin views the profession.Finally we would need to account for challenges that show up in the lower right quadrant (systems laws rules of society) such as your economic ability to try services and products as well as whether such services and products were even available. Once we have rolled through these areas it then becomes possible to look at which aspects might need to be looked at further in a more meaningful way to help you change a perspective or if just getting a blood pressure medication is all you need.To sum your question then of why you can\\\\u2019t keep an erection we would need to look at your thoughts (look at your actual thoughts during the act as well as before and after) look at your behaviors look at your physical body for issues look at where you picked up your rules and tools (culture) and look at your ability to access goods and services. They all contribute equally and need to be taken into account. So - as you can see there is no one possible answer to this but several. I hope this helps.

It helps to have friends and loved ones but you can never rely on them to fulfill all of your needs. Set some goals for your future work towards them. Focus on being the best YOU that you can be and the right people will enter your life at the right time.

There are steps family members can take through the court system to get someone involuntarily committed but it is a long process.I deal with situations like this everyday on the job. The only time an adult can be committed against their will is if they are deemed by the doctor (such as at an emergency room) to be a threat to self or others. For instance if he had suicidal thoughts and a plan to carry out the action or if he had homicidal thoughts against someone else and a plan to carry it out he could be placed on a short hold but these holds only last for a few days. This still isn\\'t a long-term solution.An adult has the right to refuse treatment and the right to make their own choices no matter how bad those choices are. If you have a way to get him to an ER whenever things like that happen such as being found sleeping outside in 12 degree weather it will help a lot. They may or may not do a short term commitment for treatment based on the situation that brings him to the ER but it\\'s a start. They can help set him up with appointments for psych and he can get on medications. You can help by taking him to appointments and making sure his medications get filled. However you can\\'t force him to take the meds so this may be something that happens a lot. With enough of a paper trail of many ER visits and that sort of thing you\\'ll stand a better chance of getting a court appointed psych ward stay.Some tips about ER visits: Don\\'t send him alone. Always go with him or have someone go with him because you will be able to give the treatment team better insight into what\\'s going on than he will. He may say everything\\'s fine and he wants to leave so they won\\'t have any reason to keep him if that is the case. Go with him.If you do get Power of Attorney take the paperwork with you when you go to the ER and to doctor\\'s appointments because they aren\\'t just going to take your word. They need to see the actual paperwork. Having it on file in their system isn\\'t good enough because paperwork expires etc. Take it with you at all times. You can also compile his medical records and that sort of thing to take with you so they can see a full history of what\\'s going on.Keep in mind that if you do get Power of Attorney this makes you his guardian and you have to take care of him. Otherwise you can get reported for vulnerable adult abuse and neglect. In fact your mom ignoring and not helping may already put her at risk of that because she is willingly doing nothing to help someone who clearly needs the help. She won\\'t be financially responsible for the hospital or doctor bills but should be held responsible for his safety. Someone should. There are group homes for people with schizophrenia.  Being responsible for someone doesn\\'t mean you have to pay their bills it just means you are going to make sure they get the care they need. That care may be placement in a long-term care facility like a group home or a nursing home. Psych inpatient hospitals aren\\'t long-term so you do need to look into other long-term options. Psych inpatient stays are temporary and are to stabilize him they\\'re not where someone stays forever.Good luck and keep up the good attitude! Work with his treatment team. Ask for a social worker.

Many couples that experience infidelity in their relationship face this important question - is it possible for us to get past the cheating or should I just move on?Deciding to stay or leave is such a personal decision one that only you can make.When an affair is disclosed or found out it can have a traumatic impact on the betrayed partner. The betrayed partner might be overwhelmed by intrusive thoughts - Wanting answers to specific questions - Wanting details. And the partner that had the affair might be feeling overwhelm around Will their partner ever forgive them? Will they trust them again? How long will it take to regain their trust again?While it is possible for couples to get past the cheating it does take a commitment from each partner to do the work needed. Because of the complexities cheating has on the bond couples have with each other I would recommend seeing a couple therapist that specializes in working with the issue of infidelity. When infidelity happens there are usually a number of secrets that accompany it and this can be incredibly difficult for couples to work through on their own.

There are certain ways that both of you could learn more about yourselves and each other that may actually serve to make your relationship stronger. Sometimes there are motivations for having an affair that can be discussed in therapy in a way that you become more aware of what each other is experiencing and where you want to go from here. It could be that learning to communicate differently would be helpful.Regarding whether you should just move on I recommend talking about with a therapist as well.

END\",\"1222\":\"   I believe that counseling (and finding a GOOD therapist) will be of significant help when the individual seeking therapy desires change improvement and overall growth. Most counseling involves homework and a level of commitment outside of session that also contributes to resolution of problems and an ability to cope with stresses in a productive way. Here are some of the key ways that therapy can help.  1. Helps to define the problem and gain a clearer understanding of where it originates. Many people seek counseling because of symptoms they are experiencing. These can include feeling sad increased sleeping substance use panic attacks self-harm isolating one\\\\u2019s self academic decline etc. Often times people are not aware of what is causing these symptoms. Having a therapist to help guide and explore why the symptoms are occurring and where they come from will give individuals increased insight and awareness into their problems.  2. Allows for a safe outlet to vent. Not everyone likes to share their problems with close friends or family members. Maybe they don\\\\u2019t want others to know of their flaws. Maybe they don\\\\u2019t want to burden others with their problems. Or maybe they just are not comfortable talking about themselves. And in some situations people do not have the option of talking with someone they know because they have no friends or family. While talking with those we know can help bring some relief it is also nice to talk with someone like a therapist who is objective and emotionally removed from given situations. Counseling gives a safe outlet in which one can express their personal feelings and thoughts without feeling judged. 3. Counselors can offer various problem solving solutions.  A good therapist usually will not directly point their client in the direction they need to go. Counseling is about growth and teaching the client to identify triggers and use effective coping strategies that will bring about emotional and psychological relief. Counselors will help clients to explore the various options available in given situation based on the client\\\\u2019s needs wants and values and will help them to choose the option that best fits with their desired outcome.  4. Gives one the tools needed to cope with current and future problems. Many individuals that seek therapy have never learned good coping strategies. Perhaps they did not have parents or caretakers to model productive ways to cope or maybe the symptoms they are suffering from are overbearing and take away the energy needed to cope. Different diagnoses require different tools however some are beneficial for any problem and any individual. These include but are not limited to relaxation techniques breathing exercises development of healthy routines using mindfulness improving communication skills and recognizing and changing maladaptive thought patterns. A good counselor will teach clients how to use these tools will often practice them during session and will assign homework for further practice and mastery of the skills.   END\",\"1223\":\" One of the most difficult challenges we face is not being heard! It is incredibly frustrating and hurtful when others especially parents do not listen. While your parents surely love you and want to understand you it may be difficult for them to fully understand your feelings and experiences. They are quite a bit older and have likely not dealt with some of the struggles that you face. I would suggest communicating your feelings to them about not being heard.Talk to them during a non-emotional moment when the discussion is not already heated. In other words do not wait until an argument ensues to have an open discussion with them about how you are feeling. Prepare them by asking them what time is good for them to talk. Let them know you have something important to get off your chest. Try and avoid using exaggerated or extreme language such as you NEVER listen you ALWAYS say... and stray away from placing blame. Instead of beginning your statements with you try using I by letting them know how their behavior effects you. Finally let them know that they are important to you and that having their trust and support would mean a lot to you. Perhaps giving them suggestions as to what you wish for and would like to see change would help them to better understand.I would also suggest that you seek guidance from a therapist teacher or school counselor if possible.Most schools have counseling resources on sight in which a trained professional is available to talk with students looking for help.Best of luck to you.

Assertive knowledgeable persistent family can improve the quality of your loved one\\'s care. Hospitals are highly pressured to discharge people quickly but they can not discharge a homeless person without someplace to go.

You can also pressure the hospital to refer to rehab after psychiatrically stablized (which may only take a few days) and that may give your brother more time to begin making clear-headed decisions.If your brother has a psychiatrist that person should be actively involved. I had a patient patched-and-released three times in spite of my advocacy and him literally beggingto remain and stop his voices.

However addiction is a family disease so you are definitely connected to it. Most people benefit from professional help whether they are the addict or the other person. You might read some material from al-anon to improve your insight into how addiction works within relationships. It is safe to say that you are likely to have a role as a co-dependent or enabler. The most common pattern is doing overt and subtle things that insulate the addict from the consequences of their behaviors. From calling out sick for the person when they\\'re hung-over to allowing money to pay for alcohol to simply remaining in the relationship these are all behaviors that make the addiction more likely to continue.Change is difficult for all of us especially when a physical dependency on a substance may be involved. But the awkward truth is that not one of us ever made a change unless we were in at least some pain. Pain in our present circumstance is a requirement to achieve change. By enabling your husband you minimize that pain. Let me state again though that his addiction is not in your control and it\\'s not for you to fix. You can however change your own behaviors in ways that might change his odds. Even if he does not get over his drinking addiction as a general rule you will be happier if you stop being a participant in it.Many people find that an addiction removes the addict from the relationship -- they\\'re not really there even if they appear to be. At the same time there\\'s a third person -- the substance. Some people choose not to remain in a relationship that\\'s constructed in this odd and off-balance way.I hope that gives you some thought-starters but I would encourage you to seek in-person help from a local provider. And I wish for you and your husband recovery and well-being. Best regardsKaren Keys LMHC CASAC END\",\"1230\":\" I would want to know where do you put your needs? Often times we show people how to treat us based on how we treat ourselves. First identify how to practice good self care which can only happen when you are authentic and real about your needs and desires.

Work on establishing healthy boundaries where you do not feel obligated to engage the complaining daily. Maybe setting a time limit to talk with your mother and practicing how to be assertive and not disrespect or aggressive. Helping your mother understand how you feel using I statements i.e ( I feel _____ when you call to talk about my sister). Maybe asking your mom how can you be supportive of her during this time other than listening to her vent. It may also be helpful for your mother to get connected with support groups to help her cope with this life change.

END\",\"1233\":\" The best way to move on is to give yourself sufficient time and space away from your ex so you can heal. That means no checking out your ex on social media platforms and no contact. In order to move on and diminish the obsessions help yourself recognize and accept that the relationship is over and make sure to get sufficient support in processing all your feelings. Once that takes place it can be useful to explore and process with a professional the meaning of the relationship and to understand your part in what transpired.Sometimes people obsess because they have difficulties accepting what\\'s already taken place and want things to be different. The key to moving forward is to be loving toward yourself to give yourself permission to grieve the loss and to start cultivating new and healthy habits\\\\/patterns. Reengage in your present life ask yourself what you want your life to look like and start creating goals and taking small steps to create the amazing life you want for yourself.

Quite often being in such a relationship is very uncomfortable as it goes against everything we believe about ourselves.First I want to say you are very brave to open up yourself to the relationship with this wonderful woman you met.Second I would like to invite you to treat yourself with compassion as you are entering this unknown territory for yourself. Doing something new and totally unfamiliar can be scary so it\\'s vital that you are kind and gentle with yourself. Acknowledge that what you are doing is scary and uncomfortable and that it will take some time to get used to it.Don\\'t judge yourself and force yourself to feel a certain way. It\\'s important that you are patient with yourself and tolerant of your discomfort. With time space kindness and tolerance your discomfort and fear will start to dissolve. Invite your new partner to also relate to your feelings in the open and compassionate way.The worst thing that you or your partner can do is to rush your feelings pressure you to feel in a different way or to say that there is something wrong with you cause you feel a certain way.

Boundaries are important in relationships. They are invisible lines that we will or will not cross. It is up to us to create and hold them. We have the ability to rethink them and change them as needed. It sounds like you have thought it through and would like to makes changes in the relationship between your mother and you. In the main question you want to avoid the family member however in the following comment it sounds like you may just want the avoid that conversation not so much your mother.Once we review the issue and decide what we need (create the boundary) I suggest opening talking with the person when everyone is calm (not in the middle of a stressful moment when we often are unable to focus and hear the other person). Always understanding that we had time to think about this issue and the other person has not (catching them off guard). State clearly your need. Such as I am not comfortable with hearing about my sister. It stresses me out. I would appreciate it if you would not bring it up anymore. If you do I will not respond and I will change the subject  It is important to use I statements. I feel this way. I will do this. We only have power over our actions. Also when we use you  comments the other person can become defensive and unable to hear what we are saying.Once we let ourselves know what we need then let the other people know our new boundary then it is up to us to follow through. We will make mistakes. Not follow through every time with our boundary. That is okay. Start again. It gets easier with practice. It is also appropriate to reconsider and change your boundary as needed. Just let the others know when you need to change it. Remember they can not read our minds.I wish you much strength and hope the best for you and your family.www.parishhealthandwellness.com END\",\"1237\":\" Hello I commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life. It sounds like you\\'re concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an addict or alcoholic. You might have a problem but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict.I don\\'t have information to know if addiction or dependence or other words would best describe where you are with drinking but it sounds like it\\'s begun to have some negatives so forgive me using words like addict dependence and so on. I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. The feedback I\\'m writing here is very general and doesn\\'t address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation. One of the ways to think about substance (mis)use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. Let me repeat that: it is a disease of avoidance. Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you\\'re avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings experiences and so on. And of course along the way you may want to look at triggers situations biological vulnerability social pressures coping skills relapse prevention planning and so on. Depending on where you are in your drinking you might very well benefit from expertise and support.Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax destress calm down etc. Also it allows feelings thoughts and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. If you were unfaithful and often angry that\\'s your first signpost. For angry drinkers it is often true that you don\\'t drink and then get angry you drink in order to express anger.I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with who is knowledgeable about addiction.

More recent data shows that children are not necessarily harmed by divorce if they keep both their parents. In other words the damaging part is losing half of themselves and losing the value of being connected to everyone who loves them especially the other parent in addition to the extra benefit there is from the other parent\\'s perspective strengths and so on.The best thing for your child is for you to be available and loving and doing everything possible to allow the child to be whole - a person who incorporates BOTH parents.

There are probably underlining emotions (fears or insecurities) that are being stirred up during your therapy sessions. Your counselor might suggest individual counseling depending on what you learn about your anxiety. In individual therapy you would have time to deal with your own stressors.

It\\'s absolutely ok to feel nervous going to therapy. I have experienced anxiety going to see my own therapist. There can be a few reasons why you might feel this way.First it is always unnerving to see a person who is a stranger and to share intimate things with that stranger. You mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions. Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with him\\\\/her.Another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things. As children we might have bad experiences opening up to others. Someone might bully or ridicule us and that experience can stay with us for a long time making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others. If this the case as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists this anxiety will subside with time and you will re-learn that it is safe to share.And the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult.Regardless of the reason it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist. Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist. END\",\"1246\":\" Hi thereThank you for your openness about the challenge you are experiencing in your relationship. Sexual intimacy is an important part of many people\\'s life but how much importance is placed on it varies from couple to couple.The first step would be to have an open conversation with your husband. It\\'s important you are both open about what you desire from sexual intimacy and how much intimacy each one of you wants. For example asking your husband how often does he want to have sex\\\\/ week or \\\\/month. When having this conversation it\\'s important that you are both respectful and open with each other. The point of the conversation is to get to know each other and not to solve a problem yet.There are couples who enjoy fulfilling platonic\\\\/friendship relationships with minimal or no sex because both partners are not interested in it. If you are both on the same page - lack of sex might not be a problem.If there is a difference in your sex drive and frequency of desire I would recommend seeing a professional relationship &amp sex therapist as a couple to help you explore your current sexual dynamic what\\'s creating it what\\'s getting in a way of connecting sexually and toassist you and your husband in finding creative solutions. END\",\"1247\":\" HiBreak ups can be very devastating and even traumatic. Recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time. It\\'s important that you don\\'t compare yourself to others. Each and every person will experience this grieving process differently. Here are a few tips to help with your recovery:1. Make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and support you friends and family. Even though you might feel like being alone make an effort to be around them.2. Although you might not feel like it try to take care of yourself as much as possible: eat healthily get regular sleep &amp vigorous or gentle exercise (depending on your mood). The last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick (e.g. flu) is to take care of ourselves even thought that\\'s what we need the most. But when we do get that chicken broth sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort. That\\'s exactly the same when it comes to emotionalpain. Take care of yourself keepyourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster.3. As much as possible put away reminders of the relationship. You might not be ready to throw things out but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet. And also block Social Media reminders. There is a lot of wisdom in the saying Out of Sight Out of Mind.4. Once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off try out something new. In a relationship we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try. Now it\\'s time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new.5. If possible change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself. Changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts mindsetand forget your ex even if just for a few hours. Even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders.6. In addition to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong I would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist.

I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on maybe inform the therapist that that you feel nervous and shaky. I am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes if this can be obtained and well received. This isYOUR time for healing and therapy should be a safe supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist that would be my first suggestion is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private and feel safe environment. When you begin I suggest putting your hand on your stomach over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and areincredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe especially when we are feeling anxious. You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases.

It\\'s also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important difficult to discuss or you are making changes that are very difficult for you.The most important thing I can tell you though is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky. Some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change. There are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive so it\\'s a good thing to discuss. Personally I can tell you that I would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100% of the time. That opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences and\\\\/or whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxiety.Thanks for writing here.

There are many different house of things that may be helpful here. I can give you some general ideas but if some of these things don\\'t get you to where you would like to go consider seeing a therapist who specializes in couples:Remember that you can only guarantee change in yourself. You can ask him to make changes but you can\\'t control whether he does or not. You can control your reactions and what you do about your own thoughts feelings and actions in the relationship.If you\\'re going to talk about something important or you really want him to listen first ask whether this is a good time.Try to talk to him without blaming finger-pointing or asking him to change (this can be difficult but it also opens a lot of doors for effective discussions).Be mindful of your packaging. By that I mean that you may have a very important message that you\\'re trying to get across. If you able to say it in a way that is clear and wrapped in such a way that he can hear what you\\'re actually saying that is helpful. If you are talking in ways that are angry or as I sometimes say wrapped in spikes that can be difficult to hear and receive. Rather than hearing what you\\'re actually trying to get across he may just hear the fact that you are angry.If your husband is able to listen to you and\\\\/or restate what you are saying and get it right or close to right let him know what that feels like to you and how important it is.If you\\'re asking questions try to avoid why question and use what makes how when where who instead. Questions starting with why can not only be difficult to answer but can also trigger a lot of emotions that some people are not ready to deal with right away.Also keep in mind that listening and being able to reflect what you are saying does not imply agreement. This may be something that would be good to discuss with your husband \\\\u2013 just because he is hearing what you\\'re saying doesn\\'t mean that he\\'s agreeing with you.Lastly but importantly some people really don\\'t know how to listen effectively. There are people who just are not taught to do that until much later in their lives. Sometimes listening to someone can actually be very vulnerability-producing. It may be helpful to ask your husband if he knows what makes him struggle with being able to listen if you notice that he\\'s really struggling.

I would stay away from feelings such as frustrated angry and irritated and use a more vulnerable emotion. The second part is what he does specifically to make you feel that way be specific! Example: when I get home and tell you about my day and you don\\'t look away from the tv. Be objective as possible when you describe his behavior. And the last part is the most important tell him what you want him to do and again be specific! Example: I would rather you turn off the tv give me eye contact and reassure me about my day.

I would encourage you to talk to your counselor about feeling a little shaky. Sharing what the process is like for you is important in your work. If you still feel unsure about sharing after several sessions it is important to take a look at that and try to understand where that may be coming from.

I think it is great that you are self-aware and want to work on this.Feeling unhappy and trapped may also mean that you are believing these negative thoughts are absolutely true. We have lots and lots of thoughts throughout the day. Sometimes we pay a lot of attention to some and some we ignore. Right now these thoughts are getting a lot of your attention and perhaps you are thinking because you are thinking them they are true. Is it really true that you trapped?

The current of the river swept silently over them all -- young and old rich and poor good and evil -- the current going its own way knowing only its own crystal self. Each creature in its own manner clung tightly to the twigs and rocks of the river bottom for clinging was their way of life and resisting the current was what each had learned from birth. But one creature said at last I am tired of clinging. Though I cannot see it with my eyes I trust that the current knows where it is going. I shall let go and let it take me where it will. Clinging I shall die of boredom. The other creatures laughed and said Fool! Let go and that current you worship will throw you tumbled and smashed against the rocks and you will die quicker than boredom! But the one heeded them not and taking a breath did let go and at once was tumbled and smashed by the current across the rocks. Yet in time as the creature refused to cling again the current lifted him free from the bottom and he was bruised and hurt no more. And the creatures downstream to whom he was a stranger cried See a miracle! A creature like ourselves yet he flies! See the messiah come to save us all! And the one carried in the current said I am no more messiah than you. The river delights to lift us free if only we dare let go. Our true work is this voyage this adventure. But they cried the more Savior! all the while clinging to the rocks and when they looked again he was gone and they were left alone making legends of a savior.

I would suggest paying attention to the way you begin dialogue with your husband. See if blame and criticism are present. When blame and criticism are included bids for connection can quickly go off track. This can sometimes start off with something like: why don\\'t you... you aren\\'t... you don\\'t... Partners can quickly go into defensive mode if they feel they are being attacked and sometimes starting off like this can feel like an attack. Also become aware of the time of day or evening when you approach your husband. Sometimes this can make a big difference for couples as far as when they can truly be present for one another.

The second most important thing is to forgive yourself this is also an important part of taking care of yourself. You might be blaming yourself and re-living moments when you wish you would have done things differently. By replaying those thoughts you remain stuck. When we begin to forgive ourselves we truly begin to heal. Lastly in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex. They are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts.

One person focuses more on solving the issue than listening to their partner. This can be frustrating for the partner who wants to just be heard.I understand that you are working really hard to listen to him and he might not be putting as much effort into listening to you. That can be really frustrating and difficult and I want to acknowledge you for wanting to improve your relationship.One of the best strategies to gettting heard is actually to BE A GOOD LISTENER to someone else.

But this can really create more effective communication if you invest time working on doing some active listening in your relationship because then you get to model those skills for your husband and allow him to see what it feels like to be listened to and then you can even teach him some of those skills. In other words you practice specific techniques that you can use and then teach later on.Here are some skills for you to use consciously and then you can teach:Pay attention and use your body language to convey that you are in the conversation. No texting or distractions. Lean in. Focus.Listen for content and for emotion. Clarify what you don\\'t understand. Try to understand the person\\'s underlying emotions.Don\\'t rush to judgement or to changing what is going on with the person. Sit in a place where you are really curious and want to understand what is going on.Encourage the other person to continue speaking Nod and vocalize that you hear what they are saying.Ask questions to get to understand the other person\\'s point of view.I believe when we can model these kinds of listening skills and the other person feels heard they will be more likely to listen to us. If you don\\'t find that this doesn\\'t spill over in that way then have a discussion about what you are practicing and that you are learning these skills to be a better listener so you can understand him better. Then explain how it might be helpful if you both tried it. If there is push back from him set up a trial period to just try the skill perhaps for 2 weeks and see if it helps. If communication is really breaking down then it might be time to work with a counselor who can help with these skills.Best of luck to you!

When you cross over from friends to a relationship it does change things. Some people are very easy going and wouldn\\'t feel threatened by what you did Others would be upset. If your boyfriend is upset by you spending time with this male friend then you need to talk about it. Each of you needs to express your feelings about the situation and listen to the other with patience and respect. Then you can make a decision on what is best for you and your relationship. Maybe he wouldn\\'t be upset if you saw this friend while you were with your boyfriend. Or maybe your boyfriend would feel better if he got to know this person better and could trust him. Most likely you can come up with a situation that will make both of you comfortable going forward. You didn\\'t do anything wrong because it doesn\\'t sound like you intended to hurt your boyfriend. But if you really care about your boyfriend then you probably care about making him upset. Instead of looking at this issue as a problem try to look at it as an opportunity to connect.

Working off of this assumption I would suggest beginning an open and honest dialogue with your boyfriend about what specifically upset him?

I would also suggest talking about how you both envision your relationship when it comes to spending time with others.If you feel like you can\\'t have this conversation without it going off track please consider seeing a couples therapist.

We carry our past with us everywhere we go and it is up to us to find resolutions to past hurts. This is often easier said than done but it is possible. From the perspective of those with whom you have shared your concerns it might be assumed that based on where you are in life and who you are now that you have already worked through any issues from your younger years. Some of our deepest scars in life are indeed invisible and suppressed. We have to get to the place where we can take care of the inner child that is still hurting by recognizing that those who hurt us - however they did might have had their own challenges which prevented them from functioning and behaving in ways we might have deeply needed.Those who have directly hurt you may not be capable of acknowledging and understanding how you were affected by their actions - even in the worst of cases. They themselves may be doing what they can either out of shame or heartbreak for their own actions to work on forgetting how they behaved toward you all those years before. How are they behaving toward you now? Can you find it in your heart to forgive those who have hurt you? Forgiveness is the gift we give ourselves and isn\\'t dependent on an apology from an offender. By forgiving (even in the absence of any apology) we are releasing the weight of the burden we are carrying that reflects the offense we feel was committed against us. Sometimes therapy can be helpful in this process. Talking with someone who can be non-judgmental and reflects an empathetic position toward you might be what you need right now. Seeking out a therapist to help you work through these negatives feelings and thoughts is much easier than trying to go it alone. I would encourage you to reach out and find someone who resonates with you on that journey so that you can begin a path toward healing.Warm regardsShawn Berthel M.S. LMHC END\",\"1309\":\" Hello. Coming to terms with the idea that you might be of a sexuality other than the one in which you were socially raised to be can be emotionally disturbing and quite unsettling. It creates anxiety maybe even panic and leaves us feeling confused and uncertain about our own sense of identity. It becomes important to first ask yourself how you feel when you are thinking of being intimate with guys or if you desire them to be intimate with you. It is important to know what impact this has on you because it can determine your level of follow through and desire in pursuing sexual activity with someone of the same sex. I am not going to pass judgment on you either way - even for having the thoughts. I have worked with the lesbian gay bisexual transgender queer (LGBTQ) community in various ways over the years. Many I speak to say they had to struggle to come to terms with this awareness about how they see themselves sexually. Maybe you are bisexual and don\\'t have an exclusive attraction to the same sex. You might consider doing some searches online for community support groups in your area to explore the feelings and issues around this topic. Talking to someone who you trust can be helpful too. Running from your feelings is not a good idea and others in a support group for sexuality issues might be able to relate to you and what you\\'re going through right now. This will offer you perspective as you think on how this plays out in your life.Counselors are typically well trained to provide clinical services to clients who are experiencing feelings and thoughts much like the ones you are having now. I encourage you to consider reaching out for help. You are not crazy or insane for thinking of working with a counselor nor of having feelings of same sex attraction. If you decide you are indeed gay then know that you are not alone and never will be alone in that feeling. There is a huge community of support for you. Additionally we all need help sometimes dealing with all sort of issues. A counselor can work more in depth with you to examine the motivations behind the feelings and help you come to terms with them more directly. I hope that you come to a place where you feel less alone and more secure with yourself as you examine this area of your life. No matter what do not fear being yourself. Again...you are not alone I promise.Warm regardsShawn Berthel M.S.

I don\\'t mean just show up and listen to the counselor for 45-50 minutes but also that the client themselves opens up and shares with the counselor the issues that brought them to counseling in the first place. This requires you to be vulnerable capable of moving past your protective measures of showing the best of yourself and allowing the counselor to see the sides of you that likely are not as favorable. Therapy works when you and the counselor engage openly honestly and with mutual trust that both of you will work for common goals - your improvement of self. It does take time and there are no quick fixes (usually) so be prepared to invest in yourself and explore the dark places.

Some people shy away from counseling because they think since they already talk about how they feel to their relatives or friends they shouldn\\'t need a counselor. However if you are having a difficult time counseling can be beneficial in helping you move forward and get your life back on track.Counseling is not like the kind of talking we do to people we know. For one your counselor does not have a history with you and has no expectations of how you will act and what you will do. In that way counselors come to a session without judgement and expectation. This gives you the platform to truly explore your thoughts and feelings. A counselor can also help you understand your motivation and help you integrate your past experiences and recommend coping skills that can help you if you are feeling overwhelmed by your emotions.Over time as you work with a counselor you will get feedback and also be able to share new insights. The work you do is based on you and where you are at. Oftentimes when we talk to friends they bring their own agenda to a conversation and while they mean well they may offer solutions that work for them and not you. A counselor will help you uncover the solutions that work best for you and help you find the motivation to follow through with your plan.Best of luck to you!

A beginning middle and end.I am always digging searching and exploring.There comes a point where things come to there natural ending.I always leave an opening for continuing counseling in the future. At least as a check in. END\",\"1337\":\" There are different reasons why a counselor may seek to terminate with a client and these will each have different processes by which the counselor will come to that decision. Here are a few examples.The counselor may determine that the client\\'s needs are outside what the counselor is competent to be able to work with. A person may have come to the counselor talking about a particular issue but either when they first met or as counseling progressed it may become clear that the issue is in fact something different or that there is an additional related issue. If that issue is outside the competence of the counselor the counselor should look for alternatives the most common of which would be to terminate and refer. Beyond clinical issues this could also come up around particular other related facts such as the culture of the client or linguistic issues. This could also be the choice of the counselor if they know someone that they feel would be a better match for the client\\'s issues.Another reason for discharge (and possible referral) would be if the relationship does not seem to be a good fit. No counselor is the right person to work with everyone. If the right level of connection is not happening the counselor will often look first at what they are doing might talk about it with the client and ultimately will admit that things don\\'t seem to be working to allow the desired therapeutic process to work. A similar process would be followed if the counselor determined that the client might not yet be ready for counseling as evidenced by lack of engagement such as frequent cancellations not doing any agreed on work between sessions showing up late or being really guarded in session.The easiest situation to decide on is when a person has met their counseling goals and have nothing new that they are working on. While this is the easiest one to determine it is also probably the hardest one for the counselor as they may be like the client in not wanting the relationship to come to an end. However counselors know that this is part of the process. They will also determine this by regularly reviewing the treatment plan or by sending in the sessions that the work has come to an end. This type of termination maybe final or may be with the intent that the client will return later to address other things that have been identified but for which they are not ready to move into.All of these (and other) situations involves the counselor being open to the relationship ending to monitoring how things are going then engaging in self reflection possibly talking with the client and then coming to a conclusion on which the counselor follows through. END\",\"1338\":\" This is a question that is very specific to each person. There are definitely some variables but I can give you some general ideas for when counseling might end:When a client has met all of their goals at least to a degree when they feel that they no longer need to work on them with the assistance of a counselorSometimes a decision is made that a client is no longer benefiting from counseling at a certain timeSometimes clients have to remain in counseling in order to receive medication. This depends on agency policy but sometimes it is a requirement. If the medication is necessary and cannot be prescribed by a primary care physician frequency of sessions is usually decreased greatlyI\\'m not sure why you are asking this question but it is also something that is often discussed at the beginning of treatment. Oftentimes discharge goals change as treatment progresses because more is known about clients their goals changes in their goals and many other things. Changes are normal but your counselor probably has discharge goals in mind at least generally from the beginning. I strongly encourage you to ask about it! END\",\"1339\":\" Usually people call me by phone they introduce themselves we chat for a bit then we schedule a time for their appointment END\",\"1340\":\" Hi thereThere are a number of reasons why a therapeutic relationship might end including but not limited to the client reaching their goals the client reaching a place of acceptance where they wish to remain or even a breach within the relationship. The last aspect should likely be taken to supervision in order to be fully processed. All of these things could happen and usually happen organically (again except for the last example).Your question however was about the counselor ending treatment. This is a bit more difficult and can be very nerve-wracking. It may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision as well. It\\'s important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client as well. Do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist have they achieved their goals or is it something else?In regular open-ended sessions I try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently. In these check-ins I use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely. I also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize. In goal-oriented sessions I check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and I remain focused and should they wish to shift their focus that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal.Often especially in longer term therapeutic relationships we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal however they are apprehensive about ending therapy. This is actually a great place to go with them why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you? Often having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery. That said it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now as the relationship seems to be ending feels more confident in bringing these up.In the case where the relationship is a toxic one terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you. It\\'s a difficult conversation but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed.I hope that this brief response can assist you going forward! END\",\"1341\":\" HelloThere are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process however they all start with picking up the phone. It\\'s most definitely an uncomfortable feeling but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief.My recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment. Listening to how they converse use their tone and inflection may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away. You may also discover rather quickly that this therapist is not the right match for you.Regardless of how you go about it I like to remind all people who call email text or walk-in therapists are a bit like pizzas - if you don\\'t like the toppings send it back! There are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy - take the time to pick one that suits you. END\",\"1342\":\" There are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated:1) Client has met therapy goals2) Client is not progressing3) Therapist is not a good fit for clientIn order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessions-by-session to determine what is helping what isn\\'t and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals. When a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to check-in periodically to make sure that they are still on track (sometimes referred to as relapse prevention).When a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client. In these circumstances referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea.

All of these are aspects of being depressed though you can be depressed and still not have depression.Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood. Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine losses or significant disappointments. Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future.I do hope that you will reach out. Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need. END\",\"1344\":\" Hello. The end of the counselor\\\\/client relationship is one of mutual respect and engagement. Counseling sessions can end for any number of reasons. Among them are the client\\'s inability to make forward progress in therapy the clinician\\'s inability to help the client (for a variety of reasons) a mutually agreed upon time frame for a number of sessions to be provided or the financial challenges of the client who decides that they need to put their resources elsewhere. In this last case a counselor should never cancel sessions with a client simply on the basis of the client\\'s inability to pay. That is traditionally seen as an unethical practice. Other arrangements can be made to provide care to the client which in itself should be paramount.When the client and therapist decide that services are done it is best if there is at least one or two more sessions to allow a case file review to occur and to bring an appropriate psychological sense of closure to the client (and vicariously to the clinician as well those this is perhaps not as important). This transition gives both a sense of having reached the end of a journey...rather than some abrupt departure from it. (An abrupt ending in therapy can have a varying level of impact both emotionally and psychologically on the client and therapist). Sometimes the closure of therapy is the result of a program of therapy being formally completed in which there is a mutually known (albeit perhaps approximate) date of when that program will be finished. In this case the client is likely feeling that impending closure and has time to prepare mentally and emotionally from a place of being the client in therapy to a place of healing growth and situational resolution.I have always worked in therapy with the following slogan (if you will) that I learned years ago during graduate school: Not every therapist is good for every client and not every client is good for every therapist. It is perhaps one of the most important guiding views I hold in working with clients. The therapeutic relationship is driven by mutuality - the desire of the client to get better at living life and the therapist\\'s desire to truly see the client heal and grow. When there is a block in this process from either side that prevents that synergy from occurring the relationship that should be established may not be able to form. Or if already formed may at some point be unable to move forward. In these instances referring the client to another type of service or clinician is appropriate. Usually this can be seen pretty quickly by either party though sometimes it is not always clear.Ultimately the client and counselor need to work together to discover if the needs of the client (which is paramount) are being met in the therapeutic engagement with their current counselor or if other arrangements need to be made to go elsewhere. If both are observant in this process they can work together to maintain that sacred space and continue to reach the goals that have been set. Eventually therapy will end but hopefully based on the client\\'s successful journey to the place where they wanted to go and thus opening the next chapters of their life to a space that is more whole and brighter. END\",\"1345\":\" Hello. Counseling often begins way before the client ever actually calls the local therapist. There is often a tipping point in the internal struggle that the client experiences where they can no longer deal with the issues on their own and thus giving the motivation to seek external help. That said clients usually go seeking therapists based on what their insurance will cover or what is likely to be more and more the case in the near future...what they are able to pay for out of pocket. That first phone call to a prospective counselor can often feel like torture but it doesn\\'t have to stay that way. Counselors are well trained to acknowledge the inherent goodness of all clients and should be able to see and hear the sense of fear in the client of being judged or put down in some way. The counselor you select should be compassionate caring able to join with you on your journey to resolving your issues or concerns and to do so without negative judgment of you as a person of worth.Once you have found a counselor you want to work with you would then schedule an appointment to meet. That first session is often very low key. There might be some forms for you to complete which will help the counselor address your concerns and learn a bit more about you. The counselor will typically provide you with what we generally call in the profession a professional disclosure or practice statement. This document (which may be several pages long) usually outlines the counselor\\'s credentials practice rules forms of payment office hours emergency contact details and confidentiality guidelines under state and federal law among other details. All of this benefits you as the client so that you are well informed and can focus your attention on why you are meeting with the counselor.In the first session it is absolutely okay to be nervous. Here\\'s a really big secret (which is important to keep in mind as counseling begins): Counselors are often as nervous (if not more) to meet a new client as the client is to meet their new counselor. It\\'s true. We as professionals are trying to put our best foot forward to impress you with our awesome counseling skills. While simultaneously hiding all the troubling unwanted issues that we ourselves have in our life too and being worried that we might not know if we can help the client sitting in front of us. What makes it even more challenging is that counselors are often put on a giant pedestal of perfection by clients (all while we as counselors tend to look at it like we\\'re standing on a three legged stool). This is normal for us when seen from the eyes of the client. Counselors and clients are both human and we both make mistakes. Coming from that place of understanding might bring a sense of ease to both the client and the therapist as they seek to work together.Part of this perception of perfection held by clients toward counselors is that the skills of the counselor might look like they have all the answers. We honestly do not plain and simple. Counselors come from life experiences (where they might be farther down on life\\'s road than you) they hold completion of various forms of training and have advanced education. Yet we are in the end imperfect beings struggling to help imperfect people. This makes it easier to be compassionate to new clients walking through our door with the hope that we will receive that same compassion in return. Very often we can find ourselves reflected in our clients\\' lives with their struggles and can become more effective at helping if we have resolved similar issues in our own life. So as you begin to seek out a therapist try looking for one who is aware of their own life issues and is actively working on them too. Someone who can meet you where you are at emotionally and can understand your sense of your struggle that you are facing at the present moment. That counselor may be a good example for you as you enter into therapy and build your own strength and thus begin dealing with the issues more effectively you bring up in therapy. END\",\"1346\":\" Hello. The dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear. Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind. When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return. Is the person afraid of being alone? Are they jealous of your current relationship? Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended? How long and\\\\/or how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner? Does your former partner not like being dumped and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can dump you instead? Some of these questions you may not be able to answer and some of them might require your own internal reflection.You likely want to make a good decision and you also might want to consider who it will impact and how that will happen. Other friends might be upset at this sudden change and it could create a strain on your friendship. You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it. Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place. Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance? How it will it impact your current relationship?Going into relationships should be done with reflection patience and full awareness. Ultimately you choose who is in your life so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making and with the ability to protect yourself from harm. No one else can make this choice for you. However gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist. In your heart you will likely find the right answer. Learn to trust that more as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it. Use your mind to analyze things but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too. The answer will arrive if you let it. END\",\"1347\":\" Hello. Workplace stress is one of those areas of living that troubles many people who need an income to survive. The interactions between you and coworkers is a mixed bag and sorting that out can be difficult. Also if you are feeling under appreciated and not well paid this can add bitterness to your lot of emotions. A few questions can be kept in mind as you work through your situation. Do you have the option of talking to your employer about your experiences and feelings with regard to your current work? Do you have local resources that you can use to find different jobs in your field? Do you have connections with employment counselors or agencies that can support you with strategies in dealing with workplace stress? These questions might cause others to bubble up and could begin a new journey into a new field.While still at your job what can you do to take care of yourself? Are you taking breaks? Do you eat lunch at the office or do you go somewhere away from the office to eat? What do you do when you have a few moments to breathe? Understanding that you can indeed find even the smallest strategies useful for self-care can help bolster your energy and give you some support as you move through the day. Seeking the support of family and friends can be helpful as well. Knowing your personal limits and when to pull back and take a break will give you a chance to recharge your mental and physical energy thus helping you face the demands of your job.

I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. For that reason I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.As far as telling girls or keeping it a secret I don\\'t really think that it\\'s necessarily one or the other at least not the first time that you meet. In other words one part of your decision-making could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date or perhaps something that you address after you\\'ve known each other for a couple of meetings. The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating. I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this.It sounds like this is an important part of you so I would think that if you were going to date someone long-term you would want them to know about the most important parts of you including that.I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to cross-dress.I\\'d also ask you to consider this: Are the people who you say this to expecting it? My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that Are they going to have questions? I would imagine so.Are you comfortable answering questions?I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends (or perhaps even with a therapist) how you would answer these sorts of questions:What exactly is cross-dressing?Does that change the gender that you\\'re attracted to?What does it mean to you?Why is it important to you?And what you want your listening person to know about you related to cross-dressing.There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.I certainly hope that you find the right person for you. I imagine that having this conversation could be stressful especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past. Remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful. END\",\"1350\":\" Hopefully both the client and counselor would together decide when to terminate counseling sessions. It\\'s really helpful for the client to leave counseling with a solid sense of what he or she has accomplished in counseling so it can be a good idea to spend some time acknowledging that in the last session or sessions. Sometimes however a client has needs beyond the scope of the counselor\\'s expertise. That\\'s a good time for a conversation about those needs and ideas of how best to meet them whether by adding in care with an additional mental health professional or transferring care entirely to a new mental health provider. END\",\"1351\":\" Good for you to know your daughter\\'s friendship circles and to notice when these have changed.While friendships are key relationships they are not the only indicator of someone not developing normally.Is your observation and opinion that your daughter isn\\'t normal based on other factors or just this one?If this is the only factor then start with reflecting on what circumstances may be influencing your daughter to socialize with younger kids.Has she ben ostracized or bullied by her peers and may be retreating to avoid further emotional hurt?Is she keeping up with her school work?Sometimes kids who feel overwhelmed by schoolwork will regress into conditions in which they feel more success and control.Are there family circumstances such as the death of someone with whom your daughter felt close? Or is there a new younger sibling in the family or a younger sibling who due to their own circumstance receives more attention than your daughter may wish for herself.Once you\\'ve reflected on which areas may be affecting your daughter gently ask her some questions about her comfort with what you theorize may be the source of the problem.Its also possible that offering her your extra time and interest may increase her sense of self so that she feels secure enough to increase her social time with her age group.

END\",\"1360\":\" Hello. Being a teenager in our society today can cause depression quite easily. We look at the world in which we live and the doubts we have about being able to make a contribution or to have value and worth with the people around us and we begin to internalize those messages of self-worth. If that alone were not enough you are trying to figure out where you want to go in life and who you are supposed to be in the world. Teens are faced with pressures of being judged by your peers for how you present yourself following current fashions possessing the trendy things and hanging out with the in crowd. Here\\'s a secret that might help with most of those issues: Not much of those problems I\\'ve just described will really matter as they might seem to right now in the real world. If you are feeling depression because you feel you lack some of those things that are seen as important by others (like your peers) I can assure you that being someone who is kind compassionate understanding of another person\\'s suffering and the effort you make to be the best person you can become in the world will far outweigh anything you experienced in your teen years.When we are young we judge everything based on what our peers have what they say the way they dress who\\'s popular who\\'s not popular and for the most of it all of that is external. So the question becomes are you trying to fix the feelings on the inside (the internal stuff) with the trappings of all the stuff on the outside (the internal)? That is to say do you feel that if you had what your friends have you would be happy and less depressed? Depression is usually a symptom of something much bigger it is not typically a problem by itself (just as a person who experiences a high temperature may likely have a cold). So fixing the symptom requires looking at the possible causes. In your post you mentioned that you live with your dad. Are your parents divorced or separated or has your mom passed away? Either of these circumstances could certainly cause depression. Finding out when you started feeling depressed might be able to pinpoint the trigger that caused it which requires looking at when you last felt really happy. It is also important to keep in mind that as a teenager your emotions are often being experienced very randomly and sometimes without cause. It is part of your emotional development but as you grow older can learn how to manage those emotions better and practice doing things that help you feel better (without causing harm to yourself).Have you tried talking to your dad about your feelings or maybe another relative if you feel safer doing so? Do you have a friend who is your best friend...someone who is there for you no matter what? If not there is a service you can use that is a national number for teens to talk with teen peer counselors. They are teens like yourself but they have some insights that might be helpful. Its called Teen Line (https:\\\\/\\\\/teenlineonline.org\\\\/). It helped me when I was in my teens and has helped lots of other teens as well. You might find a place to get some referrals to other local services in your area. If you want are in Washington state and would like to connect with me directly you call link to me via my profile page. Or perhaps finding a counselor in your local area might be useful. Most towns and cities have some form of low cost counseling. You might also check with your school for assistance.Don\\'t be afraid of not always knowing how you are supposed to feel. Adults don\\'t always have a handle on it either. Being a teenager carries a lot stress fear and uncertainty. But you are not alone and there is help if you reach out for it. I wish for you the very best and bright future.

Is it healthy to be involved in something that is not likely healthy or perhaps could even be seen as dysfunctional? In truth only you can decide the answers to these very important questions. I would encourage you to think of who benefits by being in this situation and how you might be able to find happiness in other relationships that are healthier and more positive. In my clinical view based on what I read this particular relationship does not carry the joy I am sure you want nor the healthy interactions you would expect in a functional romantic engagement with another person.Beating yourself up about potentially wasting all this time waiting for the other person to come around will not serve a positive purpose. It likely will only lower your self-esteem. There is a time to wait to see how things develop and a time to move on to other experiences. You are the one to make that choice but I would encourage you to connect with your inner higher self for the most clear answer. Chances are you already know the answer you just need to embrace it.

The first thing you can do is realize that your feelings and reactions are o.k. you aren\\'t doing anything wrong and nothing is wrong with you. The next step is to start dealing with the impact of these traumatic experiences. Identifying your feelings and knowing the thoughts and beliefs that are behind those emotions can help you regain your sense of happiness. Research shows that understanding and expressing those thoughts and feelings can help. If doesn\\'t sound like you need to do anything to change yourself but talking to a counselor can be helpful in managing your reaction to a incredibly traumatic experience. I hope this helps you understand your feelings and can get to a place where you enjoy life.  END\",\"1374\":\" That is a really tough situation that a lot of young people are experiencing right now.

The second thing is to keep in mind that their controlling behavior is most likely not about based your behavior.

Sometimes that can very helpful.As far as the more emotional or mental piece these things come to mind:Sometimes a crucial part is looking at the habit of smoking and seeing what else you can do to keep your mind and hands busy. There are sometimes toys like those available at Office Playground that may help to keep you physically occupied.There can also be changes or additions to your routine because I imagine that smoking took up a great deal of your time. Maybe when you have the temptation to get up and go to have a cigarette you could have several other things that you can get up and do instead. The list is endless but a few examples could be doing some physical exercise (with the permission of your doctor) just for a couple minutes because that could help with the craving as well completing a puzzle learning a new activity that requires using your hands (painting or knitting perhaps).Another piece of quitting smoking is often linked to anxiety or other emotional changes perhaps irritability. Depending on what it is that you may be feeling learning other strategies to use can be helpful as well.This can all be quite overwhelming and a very big life change.

END\",\"1376\":\" Goodbyes can be hard. Chances are most of the goodbyes you have experienced in your life have been difficult. Saying goodbye to a therapist can be different. It can be an opportunity to create a healthy ending in a positive relationship in your life. If you work with a therapist who is skilled then saying goodbye can be just as transformative as the therapy itself. Ending therapy is also known as \\\\u201ctermination.\\\\u201d I know \\\\u201ctermination\\\\u201d doesn\\\\u2019t have a great ring to it! However it is what it is. It is an ending of the relationship as it existed. It is reality cold and stark. Of course when I talk to clients I don\\\\u2019t use the word \\\\u201ctermination\\\\u201d I usually say \\\\u201cour goodbye.\\\\u201d Under what circumstances does therapy usually end? Therapy should end when a client does not need further assistance is not receiving any benefit from therapy or might be harmed by continuing to work with a particular therapist.In the best case scenario the decision to move on from therapy and \\\\u201csay our goodbyes\\\\u201d happens when both the therapist and the client feel like the client is ready to move on and move up! Ending the therapeutic relationship should actually be worked on from the very first session. What I mean by that is there should be an understanding that the work we do together will have an ending and that is a good thing because it means the client has gained the skills to continue working on themselves independently. So the first session I have with clients usually outlines a plan where the end goal is discussed and we both have an understanding of the skills the client wants to learn or what they hope to achieve. Now sometimes there are situations where the therapist ends the relationship and the client may take that personally it is hard when any relationship ends and it might bring up feelings of sadness and fear or abandonment. Any good therapist will end the relationship based on what is right for the client. What are some situations where a therapist might end the relationship?If the situation the client is dealing with is out of the therapist\\'s scope of practice the therapist may end the relationship and refer the client to someone else. This is in the client\\\\u2019s best interest. Another reason a therapist might end the relationship is that the therapist is in a place in her life which prevents her from being objective and helpful. A therapist who is going through a painful divorce may have difficulty working with a couple that considering divorce. A good therapist may see that their judgement may be clouded and want to refer the client to see someone else. This is good practice and helps the client.If a client is actively suicidal or actively using substances then the therapist may end the relationship and refer out for a higher level of care. The client may need to be hospitalized or may need an inpatient substance abuse treatment program. Therapy may be terminated while they are being treated and may continue after the intensive program is completed. Ending therapy should be a time for connection and bringing together accomplishments or reviewing the next important step the client needs to take. It should not be an experience of abandonment. A skilled therapist will help a client gain a new perspective on closure. For some clients it may be the one time in their lives when they get a clean ending in a healthy relationship and they get to feel a sense of control on creating that ending.Good luck to you!

A major reason to end counseling is if the counselor feels that he or she does not have the skills or experience to work with the client.

If the clinician feels that the client is not benefitting from the therapy it is ethical to suggest that the client terminate the therapy. The process of termination must not injure the client and if necessary the clinician may need to refer the client to other treatment modalities. Another reason to terminate working with a client is if the client needs a higher level of care. If the client has a crisis or is at risk of hurting himself or someone else he or she may need a higher level of care. In this circumstance the clinician may need to involve outside services such as a crisis unit. A third reason to terminate with a client is if the clinician feels that he or she cannot remain professional with the client relationship. For example if the issues that the client is working on bring up something significant for the clinician and the clinician feels that he is unable to separate that from the professional relationship. In this instance the clinician should refer the client to another therapist.

If you are paying out of pocket this diagnosis is not really required for payment but many Counselors will still perform a comprehensive assessment because we really want to know what the issues are that brought you to us.

I have to wonder from a behavioral perspective if what you are doing is useful for you. In other words does it serve a purpose in some way when you find yourself doing it. Yes this could well be an expression of anxiety or maybe some type of coping skill you have developed over the years to deal with stressful situations. Yet it sounds like you have developed a sort of knee-jerk behavioral conditioning that causes you to do this behavior during specific (or perhaps even non-specific) circumstances. Do you think it is a self-soothing behavior? Do you feel good after you have done it? The behavior itself is likely causing some form of slow physical damage so I would recommend you have yourself checked by a doctor to rule out any injury. If none exists this obviously doesn\\'t excuse the behavior it just says that for the moment luck is on your side.When we do any behavior of any kind it is good to ask if what we are doing has merit or value. Is the behavior helping us to solve our problem or is it merely creating yet another problem by doing the behavior in the first place. In the same way that a person might drink excessively because they are stressed and need to cope with some unresolved issue when they are done drinking the original problem will still likely be there but now they are intoxicated. No closer to solving the issue. When we deal with things like anxiety or depression we need to do things that work on dealing with the symptoms but also get to the root issue that created those feelings and find effective solutions. So the things we do to cope with life events need to not be ones that cause us harm but rather support us as we move forward and work to deal with what life throws at us.Sometimes seeking support from a friend or a counselor is a good idea. Being given the opportunity to express your feelings about what is going on around you and getting feedback and insight from others is much more effective than actions of self-harm wouldn\\'t you agree? So I would encourage you to find a counselor or a trusted friend who can help you find positive behaviors you can take to deal with your feelings as you also work to find the answers to the day to day issues of living a life filled with promise and opportunity.Reach out if you need help...there will likely be a hand there waiting for you.

They are keeping us stuck and creating a self-prophization. (If I think I am not worth anything I don\\'t have to try and I will keep proving to myself that I am not worth anything). There are many techniques to work through and start to change our negative self-talk. There are actually many self-help workbooks that can help with this as well. A technique I like to use is meditation or mindfulness. This can teach us to accept our thoughts (not fight them) and then learn to let them go. Release the power they have on us. If we can learn to release these and not ruminate on them this will give us the space to allow more positive and supportive thoughts to come in. Mantras can help with this as well (I AM worth a lot I AM important I have value). Saying these to yourself everyday over and over (even if at first you don\\'t believe) can retrain our brains to believe it (and allow us to believe it). I have even wrote positive mantras to myself in my bathroom mirror so I am forced to look at these throughout the day.Please remember to not be hard on yourself as you begin to attempt to change the automatic thought patterns. It took a while for you to get where you are and it will take a while for this change to kick in and feel normal.

For example name all of the blue things that you can see. You can also do non-visual groundingexercises likenaming all of the htesports teams you can think of or all of the state capitals. This will get your mind off of your anxiety and connect you to space. 2. The pretzel: This is a seated pose that will stop any anxiety attack in its tracks. Start in a seated position and cross your dominate leg over your nondominant leg. Then stretch your arms out in front of you with the back of your hands facing one another. Cross your arms in front of each other so that your palms are touching. Flip your arms into your body. You will end with your elbows by your side and your hands crossed under your chin. Close your eyes and take long breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This calming pose will help you get through even the toughest of panic episodes. 3. Bilateral stimulation and visualization: Start in a seated position with your hands placed on your knees. Tap each knee in an alternating pattern. Close your eyes and begin visualizing a peaceful setting. The combination of bilateral stimulation and visualization will help calm your body and mind. I could go on and on but these techniques should get you started. These techniques should help you manage anxiety in a pinch. Best of luck!

If you are considering working in the field I recommend emailing several counselors social workers and psychologists in your area and setting up an informational interview. Not everyone you contact will be willing to give you their time but many may.  This will help you determine which path to therapy may be right for you. Licensing restrictions and abilitiesvary state to state and a local practitioner may be able to provide you with a specific list of challenges\\\\/triumphs about their particular license and education.  Psychologists are usually PhD level practitioners and require more education to begin. LCSWs  LPCs and LMFTS can practice with a master\\'s degree. Best of luck! This is an exciting time.  END\",\"1415\":\" Hello. So someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a person\\'s life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary. Even relationships fo not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problem.What I would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection (in whatever way that occurred) is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote self-care. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the grief\\\\/loss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.I wish you happiness for every day of your life.Best wishes. END\",\"1416\":\" Hello. It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage. I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now. Marriages take lots of work and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young - good bad or indifferent. There are no easy answers to your questions and I won\\'t presume that my response to you will be the linch-pin that heals all your pain. But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections. First and foremost cut yourself some slack. No one is perfect. We fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow. Yes you\\'re right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop. You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor. Seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach. You have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respects.Joining a marriage support group can also be helpful. You can find these through local counseling resources. Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful. If you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate. Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for you.Lastly parents are imperfect. Yep...its true. They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage. We limp along and do our best. Having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us. The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life. Both with ourselves and toward other people. So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions. It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit. I am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it. If only one of you cares then 100% of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person. That\\'s not fair. So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution. All of this said seek out supportive friends and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life. One way or the other you will benefit from it.Be well. END\",\"1417\":\" It sounds like you are experiencing burnout and have very little if no job satisfaction. There are some aspects of this that are in your control and others that are not. What type of work do you typically enjoy? Do you enjoy high stress work? What keeps you in this job? Is there a reason you have stayed? Is your boss reasonable to have a conversation with? I recommend a few things. For one you may want to have a discussion with your boss about your job duties and see if there is a way to either eliminate some responsibilities or get higher pay. Another option if you are unable to have an open conversation you can start to look at an ideal work situation what would you like\\\\/ be OK with\\\\/ absolutely hate about a job. Then possibly try to look for a new job that fits these qualifications.If you are unable to leave your job you may want to attempt to balance your work life with more activities that create joy outside of work. Sometimes that balance can help you tolerate work more. I recommend that you find a supportive person to talk with and process these frustrations as burnout can lead us to do things we may regret.  END\",\"1418\":\" The easiest way to start the counseling process is to do a little research online. A quick search for the type of counseling you are looking for can be helpful. There are lots of Counselors out there to choose from so many times you will have to take it a few steps further than that. Check out their website social media and any reviews (but remember people are not always very nice). If you plan on using insurance to pay for at least part of the services look for one that is in your network. You can find out if someone is in your network by looking for providers on your insurance\\'s website. If your coverage isn\\'t that great and you know you\\'re going to be paying for it all anyway (because you\\'re an all-star and verified your coverage already with the insurance company) then you can really pick any Counselor you want but working with one that is at least out of network will give you the benefit of having it applied to your deductible. If you have any questions about that process or just want some help in getting your benefits from the insurance company once you\\'ve started counseling Better is a good option. Once you\\'ve found a Counselor you think is a good fit for you normally the best step to take here is to call and schedule your very first appointment. With many Counselors you can now send an email but a phone call can normally tell you quite a bit about someone and their clinic. Once you\\'re all scheduled they will either get you to do some paperwork before you come in or many times they just let you fill it out once you get there. From there all you have to do is show up! END\",\"1419\":\" It can be uncomfortable talking to someone about your life in the great detail that is normally necessary for counseling to be beneficial. Since you\\'re already going to counseling congratulations on taking that big first stress-inducing step. Hopefully by now you are starting to feel a little more comfortable with your therapist. It can be helpful to address this big elephant in the room and talk to your therapist about this. I do my best to help people feel comfortable when they come to counseling but regardless of how hard we try sometimes it is just a little hard to get accustomed to. The good news is the more you keep at it the more normal it will become. END\",\"1420\":\" I would not focus on what other people say.

My suggestion is to see a therapist and go from there. END\",\"1422\":\" You are right. It is not normal to hear voices that aren\\'t your own but the fact is some people do. In my experience medication seem to help. It is also important to understand when you hear voices the most - meaning it is important to understand what the triggers are. It is also important to understand when the voices are the least - meaning what helps you deal with the voices better. My clients have reported that their triggers are being in social gathering or around strangers or for some even the TV. Trying to identify your triggers is helpful for some people. Clients have also reported that listening to music watching TV being with friend or family helps them deal with their voices. Every individual is different and you need to figure out what works for you and what triggers your voices. My suggestion is to see a therapist \\\\/ health care provider and then go from there.I hope this helps.

Acknowledgement of your love feelings will most likely help you find a dignified way to accept them while at the same time slowly developing new ways to live your life in a way which does not include the actual person.Your feelings will always belong to you. The newly discovered sense of how love feels will be with you and positively influence all your relationships. There is a benefit to feeling loved even if it is not forever in this lifetime.Also your partner opened your feelings the feelings which showed in fact already were within you.

END\",\"1425\":\" For a therapist deciding to end counseling sessions or terminate working with a client is a thoughtful and intentional decision. One that is not entered into lightly.While there are many considerations counselors take into account to help answer this question I\\'ll offer an example of two areas that counselor\\'s take into consideration when ending counseling sessions:Does the client need different or more specialized care than the current counselor can provide? This requires the counselor to determine whether referring the client to another therapist or health care provider is needed.And has the therapeutic relationship reached treatment goal(s)?While this question is specific to the counselor I\\'d like to also add that a client at any time can end counseling. END\",\"1426\":\" Starting the counseling process can be daunting but here are some ways that hopefully help make the process a little less overwhelming.FirstI\\'d start with finding a therapist through a therapist directory and searching for a therapist specifically in your area and with the expertise you\\'re looking for. There are many reputable therapist directories online that offer specific information and links to therapist websites to learn more about how they can help.NextI\\'d pick two or three of interest to contact directly. Have a list of questions that are important to you that you can ask to determine whether a particular therapist is a good fit. Many therapists offer a free phone consultation to allow you both to determine whether it is a good fit.Then after you schedule the next step is to see what it\\'s like being in session to determine if the fit is still a match. END\",\"1427\":\" It sounds like you have taken on a caretaker role for a while as well as experienced some pretty severe interpersonal trauma. It makes sense that you would feel nervous around people. Working through the trauma of an abusive relationship in itself can be a difficult process. And then to add on the caretaker part can make things even more difficult. First off you may want to seek support to work through what you have experienced. Many cities offer support with survivors of domestic violence and there is a hotline to help with this 888-724-7240 as well as online resources. Processing the isolation of this relationship as well as working with your son can help to overcome the anxiety related to others. Accessing autism support networks may be of support as well. Other parents that will understand your experiences are a good and tend to be safer place to start in attempting to connect to others.Very importantly go slow and be kind to yourself as you begin to adapt to a new life of allowing others to care for you as you so clearly have for others.

Letting go of a person means separating yourself from the qualities in a partner which you value.Two possibilities exist.Either you continue to feel strongly that the qualities in the past relationship are still meaningful and you\\'d like to base your next relationship on these qualities.Or the person had qualities which are no longer relevant or necessary in your life and this is the reason the relationship ended.It is possible that even if you had an adequate exposure to certain qualities in someone that you simply miss the companionship of a relationship.See if you can figure out whether you need the qualities this person gave you or whether you simply like being part of a couple.If you like the particular qualities of your previous parter and these are still relevant to your life you\\'ll attract a partner who has similar qualities.Basically people attract what they need.The more open you are to attracting what you need in a partner the more likely your next partner will have these qualities.In this way you\\'ll get over the particular person and still have the satisfaction to be in a relationship.

Cutting down or cutting out cigarettes is very challenging and there aren\\'t any one size fits all solutions. Fortunately there are a lot of tricks and tools that you can use to stop smoking. 1. Many habits that we have are paired habits. If we do one thing then we will do the other thing. Think about the activities that you do when smoking and try to pair those activities with another activity other than smoking. For instance many people smoke while they drive. Consider planning another activity to do while driving. (It might not be driving for you but you get the idea! :)). It might be taking a walk instead of smoking on your break at work. 2. Create distance between you and the habit you are trying to break. This approach could be used in a variety of different ways. If you smoke first thing in the morning consider leaving your cigarettes in a different room in your home. Walking the extra couple of feet could help you decide not to smoke.  Leave your credit or debit cards at home and carry less emergency cash than a pack of cigarettes. With this strategy you are trying to create some distance between you the cigarettes so that you have to jump through extra hoops to get them. 3. Consider cutting back before cutting out. If you are smoking 10 cigarettes a day try smoking 9. Then cut back to 8 and so on. Having a plan to reduce harm may be more sustainable than cutting things out altogether.4. You could also talk to your doctor about the safety of nicotine patches. If you aren\\'t already pregnant this could be a great resource to help boost your success. 5. Focus on what you are gaining instead of what you are loosing. You may be losing cigarettesbut you are gaining money health taste buds an increased sense of smell lung capacity a healthy baby etc. You could plan small rewards\\\\/ treats with the money you save from decreasing cigarette purchases. I recommendmaking these purchases small and frequent to keep up the momentum rather than waiting for a big payout a couple of months down the road. Good luck! Cutting out cigarettes will be good for you and your baby.  END\",\"1467\":\" Being in this position is tough. If seeking another career opportunity isn\\'t viable there are a couple of things you can do to manage stress on the job.1. Have a ritual to begin the day: Consider setting a one sentence intention and plan tasks for the day2. Take the breaks you are offered. I know it can be difficult to step away from your desk to eat lunch or take 10-minutebreaks during the day but prioritize this if you can. Sometimes 30 minutes of downtime and fresh air can help you feel better.3. Have a ritual to end the day: If you commute by car consider an end of the day playlist. Take a walk. Light a candle. Clear your desk and write tasks for the next day. Whatever it is send a signal to your brain that it is time to end the day.4. If you do work from home or are expected to be availableafter hours set boundaries where you can. Set a timer for answering emails and stick to that. Have phone free meals.  Try to engage in activities that are rejuvenating like spending time the friends and family. 5. Try to limit alcohol\\\\/ drugs. Move as much as you can. Get outside in natural sunlight.

I have even heard much older adults clients say that when they visit their childhood home  they suddenly feel like a kid again . The old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults !I would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like I am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here. I really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until I get on my feet  and I want to be respectful of you and our home  at the same time  though I feel like it\\'s important for me to have more independence than when I was younger because I am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous.

If this is too hard to do alone  perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come up with some kind of compromise contract.  This is not an easy situation  but if you can approach your mom in a calm and mature way and suggest a planned structured discussion that doesn\\'t take place in the heat of the moment  your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live with.Good luck !!Elissa Gross END\",\"1473\":\" Hello.It sounds like you are really concerned about your daughter because you have noticed a significant change in her behavior .  It\\'s really a great first step that you are reaching out to get some ideas about what might be going on . You are clearly an observant and hands on mom who wants to be sure that her daughter is ok.This is a tough question to answer without more information . With that said  I have found that under stress people regress. In other words  many people  children and adults alike  often regress and behave differently - as if they were younger than their actual age - when under stress .  Therefore  my first question would be : has anything been happening recently that is causing your daughter stress ? This could be anything from conflict at home  recent changes such as moving  divorce  a loss of some kind  switching schools  or losing a friend or friends .  Additionally  sometimes if children are feeling bullied or left out by same age peers  they may gravitate toward younger playmates as a way to boost their social confidence .  I would suggest that you think about what stressors \\\\/ changes may have occurred recently. You may also want to check in with her teacher (s) to see if they have noticed any changes in your daughter\\'s behavior at school .I also think that you can have a conversation with your daughter in order to see if you can get a sense about whether or not something has been bothering her. Something as simple as  I have noticed that you aren\\'t spending time with the friends you used to hang out with  it seems like you have been playing with a lot of younger kids lately . Am I right about that ?  and then if she says yes you might ask a few questions such as : did something happen with your friends that is making you not want to be with them? Has something been bothering you lately ? Are you feeling upset or worried ? If she denies that there is anything wrong you might even say  I know that sometimes when I feel stressed or worried  I tend to act a little differently - sometimes I withdraw from my regular group of friends  or I get cranky and feel less like myself . I wonder if something like that is happening with you ?If you are really concerned and not getting any answers from her and \\\\/ or her teachers  perhaps you can consult with a therapist to discuss your concerns further and decide if it might help for your daughter to talk to a therapist a few times  or at the very least you can get more specific tips from a therapist about how to approach this issue with your daughter more effectively . The more detail you can provide about what you have noticed with your daughter  including any changes or new stressors  any possible patterns to this behavior  if school has become more difficult socially and or academically  the more a therapist can guide you about how best to handle your concerns and talk with your daughter in a way that is helpful to her.Good luck!  I believe that this may just be a phase and it seems to me to be well within the normal range of children\\'s behavior. I do though think that you will feel more assured about this if you can get to the bottom of what\\'s going on .  END\",\"1474\":\" Hi. This is an excellent question !  I think that the answer probably varies depending upon the particular therapist . In my work with people  once we have met and I have gotten an idea of the person\\'a concerns and the issues they want help with  I spend the next few sessions gathering as much history and as much information about the client\\'s current concerns in order to formulate some ideas about what may be causing distress . I would then share my thoughts with the client to see if they feel I am understanding them and on the right track. We would then discuss the best plan to address the client\\'s concerns . Usually I will suggest strategies that I think may be helpful and ask the client for feedback about whether or not they think my suggestions feel helpful .  I always encourage clients to be really honest with me about this. I tell them that I would hate for them to agree to try things that they know they won\\'t try just to avoid hurting my feelings or offending me. I want to be helpful and while I have the expertise as far as typically helpful strategies I really like to work collaboratively and have clients tell me what they do and don\\'t like \\\\/ agree with or not agree with when I share my thoughts about a treatment plan .

As someone who has practiced as a clinical psychologist for 25 years  I would say that crying is NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AT ALL ! Almost every single person I have worked with has cried at one point or another. Starting therapy takes a lot of courage when you work with a therapist once you feel safe  you talk about a lot of very private and potentially emotional things that you may have never discussed with anyone before. I have seen people cry with sadness  cry with relief at releasing painful things they have held onto for a long time cry because they feel so relieved that they finally feel heard.  I myself have sometimes cried with clients because some things they talk about are so profoundly moving. I can assure you that most  if not all  therapists expect clients to cry and there is nothing to be embarrassed about.  Crying can be very cathartic and can allow us to release a lot of painful feelings we have been stuffing down.  Crying is often a sign that you are really working things through and getting in touch with feelings that you need to get in touch with in order to heal .So  to summarize  don\\'t worry at all about crying! It will probably feel uncomfortable at first  but I promise you  you will not be judged for crying in therapy.  And it will be less embarrassing once it happens a time or two and you are assured that your therapist will be there for you and won\\'t judge you !Good luck !!

This makes the belief even more strong for them. They start to think why does dad keep leaving? What am I doing to keep making him go away?I believe a child needs both parents in their life.

If it is successful then the result will show very different qualities in your bf than the ones you know currently.He may be so absorbed in the recovery that he can only concentrate on this.
